            Has anarchy ever worked?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Yes. History is rich with examples of stateless
            societies, from ancient tribes to medieval
            Icelandic commonwealths, that functioned
            effectively without centralized governments.
            These examples demonstrate that organized,
            peaceful coexistence is possible through

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            In a voluntary society, essential services are
            provided by decentralized, market-driven
            solutions or through community-driven
            initiatives, rather than through coercive
            taxation. This direct accountability to users
            fosters innovation, efficiency, and higher
            quality, as service providers must respond to
            customer demand to thrive.<br />

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Safety and security are paramount. In a
            voluntary system, protection is handled by
            private security agencies directly accountable
            to their customers, alongside community watch
            initiatives, neighborhood defense organizations,
            and individual self-reliance. This competition

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            True national security emerges not from a
            centralized, coercive state, but from a
            resilient, decentralized network of self-reliant
            communities, strong voluntary alliances, and
            advanced defensive technologies that deter
            aggression. A free society's strength lies in
            its decentralized nature and the empowered
            self-defense of its citizens.<br />

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            In a voluntary system, services are funded
            directly by those who value and use them,
            through subscriptions, direct payments, or
            voluntary contributions. This model ensures
            providers are directly accountable to their
            customers, fostering efficiency, innovation, and

            This is one of the most common misconceptions.
            History is rich with examples of stateless
            societies that functioned for centuries without
            centralized governments. From the Icelandic
            Commonwealth (930-1262 CE) to Somalia's Xeer

          <div class="faq-answer">
            This objection confuses anarchy (no rulers) with
            chaos (no order). Voluntaryist societies
            actually produce more order because all
            relationships are based on mutual benefit rather
            than coercion. When people cooperate
            voluntarily, they create stable, lasting
            institutions. It's state violenceâ€”wars, police
            brutality, political purgesâ€”that creates
            chaos.<br />

          <div class="faq-answer">
            This classic question assumes only government
            can provide infrastructure. In reality, roads
            existed before states monopolized them, and
            private roads still exist today. In a free
            market, roads would be built by those who profit
            from themâ€”businesses wanting customer access,
            communities pooling resources, subscription
            services, toll roads. The real question is: why
            should a monopoly do it worse and at higher cost
            when competition drives quality and

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>Yes, but it's harder and requires more planning.</strong> Multiple families with kids are in the network—some nomadic, some on homesteads, some in hybrid situations. Key considerations:<br><br>
            
            <strong>Education:</strong> Homeschooling, unschooling, or network education guild. Many states have minimal oversight of homeschooling.<br>
            <strong>Healthcare:</strong> Direct primary care, health sharing ministries, or catastrophic coverage. Budget $200-400/month/family.<br>
            <strong>Stability:</strong> Kids need some routine. Many families choose homestead life over full nomad life, or do seasonal travel.<br>
            <strong>Income:</strong> Need more runway and backup plans. Remote work or established agorist income before transitioning.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Reality check:</strong> About 70% of network families are couples without kids, or single people. Having kids doesn't make it impossible, just more complex. Start by connecting with families already doing it—they'll tell you what actually works.<br><br>

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>This is the #1 concern and it's valid.</strong> Network members handle healthcare in several ways:<br><br>
            
            <strong>Option 1: Health Sharing Ministries</strong> ($150-300/month) - Not insurance, but cost-sharing for major medical. Examples: Samaritan Ministries, Medi-Share, Liberty HealthShare. Works for catastrophic events.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Option 2: Catastrophic Coverage</strong> ($100-200/month) - High-deductible plans through ACA marketplace. You pay first $5-10k, insurance covers major events.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Option 3: Direct Primary Care + Savings</strong> - Pay doctor directly ($50-150/month membership), self-fund routine care, have emergency fund for major events.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Option 4: Medical Tourism</strong> - For planned procedures, go to Mexico/Thailand where costs are 60-80% lower. Many members do this.<br><br>
            
            <strong>The hard truth:</strong> You're taking on more risk than employer-provided insurance. Budget $200-500/month for health costs. Have $5-10k emergency fund. Know that a major medical event could financially devastate you. This is the trade-off for freedom.<br><br>

            I have student loan debt / medical debt. Can I still do this?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>Yes, but deal with it strategically first.</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>If it's federal student loans:</strong> Income-driven repayment plans can drop payments to $0-50/month while you build agorist income. After 20-25 years, remaining balance is "forgiven" (taxed). Many network members keep minimum federal loan payments while building freedom.<br><br>
            
            <strong>If it's private debt:</strong> Harder. Options include: (1) Pay it down aggressively before transitioning, (2) Negotiate settlement (often 40-60% of balance if you can pay lump sum), (3) Make minimum payments from agorist income, (4) In extreme cases, some let it default and deal with consequences.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Medical debt:</strong> Often negotiable. Many hospitals accept 30-50% settlements. Medical debt also has weaker collection mechanisms than other debt.<br><br>
            
            <strong>The reality:</strong> High-interest debt ($500+/month payments) makes transition much harder. Either pay it down first, or find high-income agorist work to cover it. Don't let debt keep you trapped forever, but don't ignore it either.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Network resources:</strong> Members who've navigated debt while transitioning can advise on strategies.

            What's the actual failure rate? How many people try and give up?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>We track this and we're honest about it:</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>Full-time nomad life:</strong> ~35-40% quit within first year. Most common reasons: vehicle problems, loneliness, income instability, realized they need more structure.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Agorist business (full-time):</strong> ~40% return to W-2 work within 18 months. Most common reasons: insufficient runway, underestimated expenses, couldn't generate consistent income.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Homestead/community living:</strong> ~25% leave within first year. Most common reasons: personality conflicts, isolation, harder work than expected, financial strain.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Important context:</strong> "Failure" often means finding a hybrid approach (part-time W-2 + agorist income) or discovering this particular path doesn't fit. Many people who "fail" at one approach succeed at another. And many who leave come back better prepared.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Success factors:</strong> People who succeed typically: (1) Test thoroughly before committing, (2) Have 6-12 months financial runway, (3) Stay connected to network support, (4) Adapt when plans don't work, (5) Build multiple income streams.<br><br>

            I'm an introvert. Do I have to be super social to make this work?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>No, and actually many successful network members are introverts.</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>Introvert-friendly paths:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Remote work:</strong> Dev, writing, design, consulting—all can be done with minimal social interaction</li>
              <li><strong>Craft production:</strong> Make things in solitude, sell at festivals (short intense social bursts)</li>
              <li><strong>Homestead life:</strong> Work land, raise animals, occasional community interaction</li>
              <li><strong>Online bounty board:</strong> Trade digitally, meet in person only when necessary</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>What you DO need:</strong> Some social connection for mental health and network support. But this can be: occasional meetups, online forums, a few close relationships vs constant interaction.<br><br>
            
            <strong>What to avoid:</strong> Caravans (constant group interaction), festival vending as primary income (exhausting for introverts), community living situations with mandatory daily interaction.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Real example:</strong> "I'm deeply introverted. I work remote dev 30hrs/week, live on a quiet homestead, see network friends maybe once a month. It's perfect. I couldn't do van life or caravans." —Alex, 34<br><br>
            
            <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Design your path around your personality. Freedom means working WITH your nature, not against it.

            Can I do this part-time while keeping my job? Or is it all-or-nothing?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>Part-time/hybrid is actually the recommended starting approach.</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>Hybrid models that work:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Agorist side income + W-2:</strong> Build $500-1,500/month agorist income while employed. Many stay here indefinitely.</li>
              <li><strong>Part-time W-2 + agorist work:</strong> Negotiate 20-30hrs/week employment, use rest for agorist business.</li>
              <li><strong>Seasonal work:</strong> W-2 work winter (save heavily), agorist summer (festivals, travel, building).</li>
              <li><strong>Freelance + agorist:</strong> Some platform work (Upwork) for stability, agorist work for values alignment.</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Why hybrid works:</strong> Reduces risk, provides testing period, maintains health insurance, builds runway, proves income potential before committing.<br><br>
            
            <strong>When to go full-time:</strong> After 6-12 months of consistent agorist income ($1,500+/month), with 6+ months expenses saved, and confidence you can scale income.<br><br>
            
            <strong>The truth:</strong> About 30-40% of network members are hybrid. They participate in festivals, trade on bounty board, attend events, but keep some traditional income for stability. That's completely valid.<br><br>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>Everyone has skills, and you can learn more.</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>Skills you might not realize are valuable:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Can you cook? → Food vending, meal prep, catering</li>
              <li>Can you clean well? → Mobile cleaning services, festival cleanup crews</li>
              <li>Are you organized? → Help others with bookkeeping, organization, project management</li>
              <li>Can you drive? → Transportation services, delivery, rideshare within network</li>
              <li>Are you strong? → Moving help, construction labor, festival setup</li>
              <li>Can you talk to people? → Sales, customer service, event coordination</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Learn high-value skills through guilds:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>3-6 months to learn:</strong> Basic carpentry, food preservation, soap making, basic repairs</li>
              <li><strong>6-12 months to learn:</strong> Welding, electrical, plumbing, mechanics, coding basics</li>
              <li><strong>1-2 years to master:</strong> Advanced crafts, specialized trades, complex services</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Start with labor:</strong> Many people begin by offering basic labor at festivals (setup, teardown, hauling). Pay is modest ($15-25/hr in trade) but it's entry into the network and you learn while earning.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Real path:</strong> "I had zero skills. Started helping at festivals for cash and camping. Learned leatherwork from a guild member. Now I make $2,500/month selling at festivals." —Jordan, 27<br><br>

            I'm over 50/60. Is it too late to start this?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>Absolutely not—and you actually have advantages.</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>Advantages of starting older:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>More savings:</strong> Likely have more financial runway than 25-year-olds</li>
              <li><strong>Skills/experience:</strong> Decades of knowledge to monetize</li>
              <li><strong>Network:</strong> Professional connections that can help</li>
              <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Know yourself better, less prone to impulsive decisions</li>
              <li><strong>Less to lose:</strong> If kids are grown, fewer dependents to worry about</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Real examples in network:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>62-year-old retired teacher now runs education guild, teaches network kids</li>
              <li>58-year-old former corporate exec consults agorist businesses, makes $4k/month</li>
              <li>67-year-old craftsman teaches woodworking, sells high-end pieces</li>
              <li>54-year-old nurse offers direct-care medical services, better income than hospital work</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Challenges to consider:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Health:</strong> Medicare at 65 helps, but pre-65 health insurance is expensive. Plan for $400-800/month.</li>
              <li><strong>Physical demands:</strong> Nomad life/festivals can be physically taxing. Consider homestead or remote work paths.</li>
              <li><strong>Tech learning curve:</strong> Crypto, online tools—younger folks can help you learn</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Your age is often an asset, not a liability. The network needs experienced people. Start where you are.

            What about retirement savings / 401k? Do I lose everything?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>You don't lose it, but you have strategic decisions to make.</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>Option 1: Leave it alone</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Keep 401k/IRA where it is, let it grow tax-deferred</li>
              <li>Access at 59½ without penalty (or 55 if you separate from employer)</li>
              <li>This is the most common approach for people with substantial balances ($50k+)</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Option 2: Early withdrawal</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>10% penalty + income tax on amount withdrawn</li>
              <li>Only makes sense if you desperately need runway capital</li>
              <li>Example: $20k withdrawal = ~$7k taxes/penalties, $13k usable</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Option 3: 72(t) distributions</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Take "substantially equal periodic payments" before 59½ without penalty</li>
              <li>Complex IRS rules, consult someone who knows them</li>
              <li>Good if you need steady income from retirement accounts</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Option 4: Roth conversion ladder</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Convert traditional IRA to Roth, pay taxes, access contributions in 5 years</li>
              <li>Advanced strategy, requires planning</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Network perspective:</strong> Many members keep retirement accounts as backup/future security while building agorist income now. It's not all-or-nothing. You can have both systems working for you.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Real approach:</strong> "I left my $80k 401k invested. It's my age 60+ backup plan. Building agorist income now for ages 40-60. Best of both worlds." —Sarah, 42

            <strong>Healthy skepticism is good. Here's how to evaluate any group, including ours:</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>Cult warning signs we DON'T have:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>❌ Single charismatic leader everyone follows</li>
              <li>❌ Required belief system or ideology</li>
              <li>❌ Punishment for leaving or questioning</li>
              <li>❌ Isolation from outside friends/family</li>
              <li>❌ Financial exploitation (required donations, giving money to leaders)</li>
              <li>❌ Love bombing then control</li>
              <li>❌ Information control (can't read outside materials)</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>What we actually are:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>✅ Decentralized network, no central authority</li>
              <li>✅ Voluntary association—come and go freely</li>
              <li>✅ Keep relationships with non-members</li>
              <li>✅ Question everything, including our ideas</li>
              <li>✅ No money goes to "leaders" (there aren't any)</li>
              <li>✅ Members disagree on tactics, approaches, details constantly</li>
              <li>✅ Access to all outside information encouraged</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Red flags that would concern us too:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>If someone demands you cut off family/friends → Not okay, leave that situation</li>
              <li>If someone pressures you to give them money → Report to network, warn others</li>
              <li>If you can't leave or question without consequences → That's not us, that's a bad actor</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>How to verify:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Visit a festival, meet members in person, see if people are weird/controlled or normal</li>
              <li>Ask hard questions—we answer them honestly (see this entire FAQ)</li>
              <li>Talk to people who left—they'll tell you if it was cult-like</li>
              <li>Take it slow, don't rush into anything</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Bottom line:</strong> We're a network of people building alternatives to state systems. If someone's trying to control you or take your money, they're violating network principles. Report them.

              <li>"Husband refused. I went to Porcfest alone, loved it. We divorced 6 months later. Hard but necessary." —Emma, 31</li>
              <li>"Partner doesn't participate but supports me. I do agorist work, they keep W-2. Works for us." —Alex, 29</li>

            <strong>Advice:</strong> Don't force it. But also don't let fear of their disapproval keep you from exploring. Many relationships survive this; some don't. Know yourself and your priorities.

            How do I handle taxes if I'm doing agorist work? Do I just not file?

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>This is sensitive and you need to make informed decisions.</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>Legal disclaimer:</strong> We're not giving legal or tax advice. Consult a professional for your situation.<br><br>
            
            <strong>The spectrum of approaches members take:</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>1. Full compliance (low risk):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Report all income, pay all taxes</li>
              <li>File as self-employed, take business deductions</li>
              <li>Sleep easy, no legal risk</li>
              <li>Still better than W-2 (no boss, more deductions, keep more than you think)</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>2. Cash-only, underreport (medium risk):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Take cash payments, report some but not all income</li>
              <li>Risk: IRS audit could catch this, penalties + interest</li>
              <li>Many small businesses do this (not just agorists)</li>
              <li>Reality: IRS audits <1% of returns under $200k income</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>3. Barter/crypto, don't report (higher risk):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Trade goods/services directly, use crypto, no USD transactions</li>
              <li>Technically supposed to report barter income (almost nobody does)</li>
              <li>Crypto: complicated, consult crypto tax specialist</li>
              <li>Risk: If IRS investigates and finds unreported income, serious penalties</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>4. Don't file at all (highest risk):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Some choose complete non-compliance</li>
              <li>Risk: Criminal charges possible (rare but real)</li>
              <li>Only viable if you have near-zero documented income</li>
              <li>Not recommended unless you understand consequences fully</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Practical advice:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Start with full compliance, then decide your risk tolerance</li>
              <li>Keep good records regardless of what you report</li>
              <li>Many successful agorists pay SOME taxes (just way less than W-2)</li>
              <li>Don't take tax advice from random people—consequences are yours alone</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Network position:</strong> We support tax resistance philosophically, but we can't make this choice for you. Know the risks, make informed decisions, don't assume others will bail you out if there are consequences.

            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
            How do I know people in the network are trustworthy?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>You don't automatically—trust is earned through verification and time.</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>Network vetting system:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Outer realm:</strong> Public events, anyone can attend. Low trust, high caution.</li>
              <li><strong>Frontier realm:</strong> Verified through host connections or event participation. Medium trust.</li>
              <li><strong>Core realm:</strong> Multiple trusted members vouch for you. High trust, but still not blind.</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Personal vetting practices:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Start with small transactions before big ones</li>
              <li>Get references from other network members</li>
              <li>Meet in person when possible before partnering/trading</li>
              <li>Trust your gut—if something feels off, it probably is</li>
              <li>Share information about bad actors (we have reputation systems)</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Red flags:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Pressures you to act fast ("this deal won't last")</li>
              <li>Won't provide references or gets defensive when asked</li>
              <li>Has pattern of burned bridges in network</li>
              <li>Asks for money upfront before delivering value</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>What to do if scammed:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Report to network hosts/coordinators</li>
              <li>Warn other members publicly</li>
              <li>Document everything</li>
              <li>Don't expect network to make you whole—that's not how it works</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Reality:</strong> Scams happen (though rarely). The network is better than random Craigslist, but worse than having legal recourse. Verify, start small, trust slowly.<br><br>

            What if someone steals from me / assaults me? No police means no justice?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>No police doesn't mean no consequences or justice.</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>For theft/property crimes:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Immediate:</strong> Network members nearby can help recover property, confront thief</li>
              <li><strong>Reputation:</strong> Thieves get blacklisted, warned about across network</li>
              <li><strong>Restitution:</strong> Pressure for repayment, community enforcement</li>
              <li><strong>Exclusion:</strong> Banned from events, properties, network resources</li>
              <li><strong>Legal option still exists:</strong> You CAN still call police if you want</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>For violence/assault:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Immediate:</strong> Self-defense, others intervene to stop it</li>
              <li><strong>Serious response:</strong> Network takes violence very seriously</li>
              <li><strong>Permanent exclusion:</strong> Violent people are removed and blacklisted</li>
              <li><strong>Legal option:</strong> Many members DO call police for violent crimes</li>
              <li><strong>Community safety:</strong> Information shared widely to protect others</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Reality check:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Police often don't solve property crimes anyway (clearance rate ~14%)</li>
              <li>Network reputation systems often MORE effective than police for minor theft</li>
              <li>For serious violence, most members still call police despite philosophical objections</li>
              <li>Prevention (vetting, awareness, self-protection) works better than response</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Personal security:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Many members carry for self-defense (legal in most states)</li>
              <li>Travel in groups when possible, especially for new members</li>
              <li>Learn de-escalation and conflict resolution</li>
              <li>Choose who you camp near / stay with carefully</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Violent crime is rare in network (way less than general population). Property theft happens occasionally. Network response is social pressure + exclusion, which is often more effective than police for our community.<br><br>

            <strong>Most of what we do is completely legal. Some things are gray area. Know the difference.</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>100% Legal:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Trading goods/services (as long as you report income for taxes)</li>
              <li>Living in RV/van in most places</li>
              <li>Camping on public lands (BLM, national forests)</li>

            <strong>Gray areas / Depends on location:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Vending without business license (some places enforce, most don't)</li>
              <li>Vehicle dwelling (legal in some cities, banned in others)</li>
              <li>Bartering (supposed to report as income, almost nobody does)</li>
              <li>Building without permits (legal on agricultural land in some counties)</li>
              <li>Cash-only business (legal but IRS might scrutinize)</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Clearly illegal (high risk):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Not reporting any income / not filing taxes (tax evasion)</li>
              <li>Selling Schedule I substances (yes, even at festivals)</li>
              <li>Operating unlicensed medical practice</li>
              <li>Trespassing / squatting on private property</li>
              <li>Ignoring court orders / warrants</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Risk management:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Start with fully legal activities, then decide your risk tolerance</li>
              <li>Know local laws where you are (vehicle dwelling laws vary drastically)</li>
              <li>Don't take legal advice from internet strangers (including us)</li>
              <li>Have bail fund / legal support if you choose gray/illegal activities</li>
              <li>Remember: consequences are yours alone</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <strong>Network philosophy:</strong> We support peaceful non-compliance with unjust laws, but we can't protect you from consequences. Make informed choices.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Reality:</strong> Most members operate in legal-to-gray-area zone and face minimal issues. Those who go fully illegal know the risks and accept them.

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            This is one of the most common misconceptions.
            History is rich with examples of stateless
            societies that functioned for centuries without
            centralized governments. From the Icelandic
            Commonwealth (930-1262 CE) to Somalia's Xeer
            legal system to medieval Ireland's Brehon Law,
            anarchist principles have been successfully
            applied throughout human history.<br />

            Wouldn't anarchy just lead to chaos?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            This objection confuses anarchy (no rulers) with
            chaos (no order). Voluntaryist societies
            actually produce more order because all
            relationships are based on mutual benefit rather
            than coercion. When people cooperate
            voluntarily, they create stable, lasting
            institutions. It's state violenceâ€”wars, police
            brutality, political purgesâ€”that creates
            chaos.<br />

            But who will build the roads?

          <div class="faq-answer">
            This classic question assumes only government
            can provide infrastructure. In reality, roads
            existed before states monopolized them, and
            private roads still exist today. In a free
            market, roads would be built by those who profit
            from themâ€”businesses wanting customer access,
            communities pooling resources, subscription
            services, toll roads. The real question is: why
            should a monopoly do it worse and at higher cost
            when competition drives quality and
            efficiency?<br />

          <div class="faq-answer">
            People who run businesses that meet real needs
            will continue to do soâ€”and will thrive even more
            without government interference. As long as they
            provide reasonable alternatives to current
            government-entangled operations, they'll find
            eager customers in the free market. The key
            difference is they'll compete on quality and
