				<p>
					The likelihood of a proposal&rsquo;s success or
					failure lies in its definition and terms. Because
					the network is a system of ideas that can be
					recreated by anyone who has heard the methodology,
					our proposal is one that requires no money and no
					one person or group to bring it through to
					completion. All that is needed is a simple
					redirection of attention and resources away from
					what is unsavory and towards a network that will
					truly provide for us.
				</p>
				<p>
					An idea cannot fail when its success does not rely
					on monetary achievement, any one person attaining
					notoriety for a project, or the first iteration of
					the project to see the goal to completion.
					Different projects have failed due to definition
					alone. If the definition of success is that one
					location persists or that one group of people
					survives, the plan is not great enough.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyone in the next 100 years could find this set
					of instructions and re-create what we are doing
					now. But there will be no need to start from
					scratch. As soon as the number of people are
					proliferating the ideas contained herein, there
					will be more aversions and more resiliency because
					of them. We do not need to be attributed to the
					version that succeeds. We will always only be one
					group who saw what was possible. I made sure to
					write down our ideas as we lived them out.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your work should be designed so that you want it
					to be stolen. Through replication grows notoriety.
					More people exposed means more people knowing it
					exists at all. If one person's desire for
					recognition, for ownership of an idea, an entire
					project can fail to launch. Our plan is, among
					other things, to spread to all people the
					recognition of what is possible and what is
					lacking in the current narrative. This will make
					it easier to take responsibility for ones own
					narrative outlook that they ultimately share with
					the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is the workbook for how the world succeeds
					when enough of us choose to do so.&nbsp;

				</p>
				<p>
					We can all imagine ways that a limited number of
					people could take down the beast. For example, if
					all liberty minded individuals refused to pay
					taxes, and it became a well known movement, then
					there is a good probability that the news would
					become viral and enough people would join in this
					endeavor to defund the governemnt. There are also
					easy ideas for how to operate as a society beyond
					this defunding - coordinating with your friends
					and neighbors to show up as a group to the scene
					of a dispute or incident is a great example. This
					is also the concept of militia. Strong ubiquitous
					self-defense is how we will defend ourselves
					against foreign or domestic threats. We are
					providing and helping to provide whatever extra
					support systems are needed to get the solution
					going and to normalize the conversations around
					the new lexicon of reality and the idea of having
					no overarching government.

						<em>Bring Everyone Along&nbsp;</em>
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					We want the option of freedom for all. Coersion is
					something that affects all aspects of our lives.
					We can run away into the woods and wait for the
					laws and society to come out and reach us there,
					or we can take actions to make sure the larger
					social structure in which we exist becomes less
					coersive to us over time. If your plan
					doesn&rsquo;t bring more freedom to the greater
					world you live within as well as to your private
					world, you are not on the wrong path; but we want
					to help expand your personal vision so that you
					can coexist in a network with other like-minded
					individuals. We are adding resources and
					connecting people to resources that aren&rsquo;t
					easily attainable in this current world. We
					believe it is easy to add a truly altruistic
					component to freedom when an option is offered
					that is competitive and readily available. For too
					long we have been oppressed by a government that
					does not serve us.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of us have questions such as: Why can&rsquo;t
					my loved ones find a community that provides for
					them instead of depleting them? Why can&rsquo;t we
					find affordable local food that doesn&rsquo;t fund
					the state? We have the answers for these
					questions. The State itself is unnecessary, and
					without it, we would be able to live as makes
					sense.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Many have the option to move out of the toxic
					cities, get food from local sources, and protect
					themselves far beyond the usual defenses such as
					pepper spray and a cell phone. However, some
					can&rsquo;t leave the statist parts of their lives
					as easily based on personal or family health
					conditions, child custody issues, or other
					obligations. This will not always be the case,
					however. There will be agorist solutions to all of
					these issues. The more resilient and fail-proof
					our networks are, the harder it will be for those
					in control to restrict our actions. There will be
					more and more options available and nobody can
					predict how amazing it will turn out.

						<strong><em>Our Exit Strategy:</em></strong>
					</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					Government should be optional, not required. We
					are FREE people, are we not? We aren&rsquo;t
					trying to abolish the State. If there are people
					who still wish to use a State for provision of
					specific goods or services, they should still be
					free to contract in such ways, but again, they in
					the NEW realm will enter into such contracts
					voluntarily and with the free-will choice to say
					no without punishment or retaliation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The idea is to help everyone who is having trouble
					redirecting their income stream and expenditures
					to purely agorist sources - so that we can keep
					the wealth in the family and grow a system that
					will stand resolute against all threats.
				</p>
				<p>
					We know this will work and we want to help form
					and strengthen the bonds that will replace weak
					supply lines currently &ldquo;providing&rdquo; for
					us. The necessity of the State is the story we
					tell ourselves. We can get everyone we know to
					stop telling that story. We are building a network
					of capable people who can protect each other and
					the world. We are on voluntary teams that work
					outside of the government.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have a business model that cannot fail. The
					value people are already generating can be
					redirected towards the agorist network and thus go
					much further towards true growth and prosperity.
					This enables a lifestyle maximized for
					freedom.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					All interactions we take part in are in a free and
					sovereign world. We are taking all transactions
					out of the city. We are making sure the money we
					spend goes towards a system that will protect us,
					not towards a system that will hurt us. So every
					interaction should be taken from the
					government/taxes and utilized by only
					voluntaryists who are making the new world.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are creating spaces that you can live in free
					of charge so that you can detox for as long as you
					need. Our network provides a means of achieving
					whatever life goals you have in a way that
					doesn&rsquo;t fund wars but actually helps others
					gain security. You will see the way in which you
					can finally align yourself with the way you are
					acting out your own real-life adventure. We have a
					way to help you expand your impact on those you
					care about while reducing your risk and the risk
					of those you do business with. With our network,
					you have the prospect of real security, wealth,
					privacy, and community. On top of all of this, you
					will witness the structure of the world change
					based on your input.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you see what is really possible in this
					moment, in this lifetime, you will see the value
					of embarking on your own journey in the Realm. All
					it takes is spreading this knowledge to the people
					who will want to do something about it and create
					the change they want to see.
				</p>
				<p>
					The knowledge of our slavery is hardly as
					important as the knowledge of our power and all
					the tools and manpower that we already have at our
					disposal to fight back against tyrants through
					nonviolent, non-confrontational means.

					years is what has been lacking in most of the
					freedom spaces we have seen.
				</p>
				<p>
					Agorism as we see it is a strategy one can employ
					in order to fight, reduce, or obsolete the state
					through counter-economics. To align ideologically
					with agorism does not make one an agorist. Agorism
					acknowledges that there is an economic war between
					free markets and State-controlled and extorted
					markets. By your lifestyle, actions, career, and
					economic choices, you choose which side of that
					war you stand on.
				</p>
				<p>
					Animal rights aside, it is more ethical to consume
					agorist beef than it is to consume organic vegan
					produce that you bought at a grocery store if you
					look at all the taxes that were extorted through
					the life of the product. The only murder you are
					funding was of one cow who you could verify was
					treated well vs. the exploitation of everyone
					(including murder and death of innocents) when you
					buy groceries. The focus that will bring us
					together and sustain us is around how you choose
					the outer network you are supporting. But when the
					goods and services offered in the network are too
					expensive, it can&rsquo;t get going nor remain
					sustainable or accessible to its
					&ldquo;affiliates&rdquo;.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most important for all members of the network is
					the understanding of how things are when there are
					no government restrictions, only private people
					handling their own business. They have to
					understand that the problem is not with one thing
					or another, it's not with the language but with
					the story itself.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Why don&rsquo;t we write plans in which we are the
					number one hero of our own life, pursuing our
					wildest fantasies? It&rsquo;s not our fault - we
					are tricked. We are told we will be persecuted by
					the government if we pursue means that give us the
					freedom to flourish and grow resilient networks.
					Instead, each person is living in an isolated node
					of a largely directionless network of people,
					unable to offer even their own eyes as backup to a
					network they actually would benefit from
					supporting. We have to create a new option. The
					option where people choose for themselves.

					If you could choose how many sources you wanted
					when it came to organic produce, it might be easy
					to imagine paring it down to a handful of local
					farms for your groceries - but if it came down to
					choosing a police force that would either protect
					you in a time of need or potentially take you to a
					cage for any number of reasons whenever they
					encounter you, having another option can be a
					matter of life or death.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why don&rsquo;t we have more choices when it comes
					to the protection agencies we fund and are subject
					to in our own spaces? That is a whole other
					discussion but the answer to meeting the needs of
					society is a free market where consumers are
					allowed to choose the services they want to
					subscribe to and the agencies they want to be
					involved in. That market is something each of us
					have the fortune of securing in this time and for
					generations to come.

					Your &ldquo;Network&rdquo; is a physical
					manifestation of your interactions. Interactions
					with intention can result in networks with
					intention, and the clusters and groups of
					individuals that result therefrom.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Your network already exists. Now, identify your
					trusted &ldquo;subnet&rdquo;, or network of
					individuals you have established trust with, who
					share your intention and objective of creating a
					more free world for themselves and others, and
					whom you have established sufficient moral and/or
					ethical common ground with. If they are a
					potential threat to you or yours, confront them
					about it and establish healthy boundaries with
					them. If they do not respect your boundaries, do
					not consider them a part of your trusted subnet.
				</p>
				<p>
					Essentially, we are advocating individuals
					establish decentralized (enclaves), both localized
					and dispersed, aimed at making freedom more
					accessible for others. This guide will go into
					detail about how networks will solve the issue of

					One of the easiest ways to create more wealth is
					to make sure your expenditures are not going
					toward taxes. When you give your time and

					to those who seek to concentrate their wealth into
					a network that focuses on manifesting freedom
					beyond itself. Is the person you're selling your
					goods/services to an anarchist who is actively
					seeking to manifest freedom for others? Or are you
					giving your fruits away to be funneled/fed back
					into the statist paradigm/system? Vote with your
					wealth. Let your wealth work for you toward what

					Voluntaryists adhere to a philosophy based on the
					idea that all human interactions should be
					voluntary. If you take those ideas to their
					conclusion, you are an anarchist. The world we
					envision includes voluntary relations between
					equals, rather than between rulers and subjects.

				<div class="headerbox">
					<h4>
						<em>Without rulers. Not without rules.</em>

				<p>
					Anarchy is about individuals deciding for
					themselves how they will interact with the world.
					This does not mean they will be able to oppress or
					aggress upon others without repercussions.
					Voluntaryism is Anarchy because property rights
					and self-ownership are immutable but do not ever
					necessitate coercion or force such as telling
					others what they can and can&rsquo;t do with their
					property. In the current system, do you feel like
					you have control? In a voluntaryist world, there
					is no legal way to aggress against others, and you
					are free to determine the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; over
					your own property.
				</p>
				<p>
					We define evil as the destruction of freedom. A
					choice for the lesser of two evils is still a
					choice for evil and will always result in evil.
					You never have to choose evil. Just like the
					trajectory of all evil is more evil, the
					trajectory of all tyrants, both big and small, is
					more tyranny. The ends don&rsquo;t justify the
					means. The means and the end are the same. Freedom
					must be taken.

					Decisions are best made by the people who are

					most people. Such &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; are
					usually only made possible through compulsion. The
					best solution for everyone seeking a voluntary and
					peaceful world is to resist and refuse
					involuntary, compulsive strategies while being
					tolerant and supportive (or at the very least not

				<p>
					Most of us are already Voluntaryists and we all
					already live in a state of anarchy. We live in
					anarchy now. We define having
					&ldquo;authority&rdquo; as having power over and
					the right to exercise that power over someone or
					something. There is no such thing as authority
					beyond the self because no one has the right to
					exercise their will against another&rsquo;s will.
					We are free to act as we like. The game of rulers
					and subjects is just a story we tell ourselves. We
					are hindered by the people called the police force
					(see our section on voluntary means of
					defense).&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					We can become more free from government bullying
					by building alternate networks of free people.
					&ldquo;Government/<em>the state</em>&rdquo; is the
					belief that some people can possess authority
					(power and the right to exercise it) over other
					people. The belief that some of us are rulers
					while the rest of us are subjects and must obey is
					a story people tell themselves. Some people stand
					up and defy tyrants. Luckily, resisting tyranny
					does not require violence or aggression.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are providing opportunities and options so that
					people don&rsquo;t have to seek services that the
					proceeds from are going towards the government and
					people who also drain their resources to the
					government; granting them lesser autonomy<em>
						and the perpetuation of the under-supplied
						agorist market.</em

					Any action can be a good expenditure of time, but

					&nbsp;In order to achieve anarchy, enough
					individuals must choose a lifestyle that makes
					freedom a more comfortable and easy choice for
					others while avoiding choices that perpetuate
					self-enslavement by making it easier or more
					comfortable for people to continue making
					lifestyle and purchasing decisions that perpetuate
					the continued existence of the State. No business
					built, family established, or garden tended will
					make the world more free if those things are not
					also done with the intention of making the choice
					of freedom for others more appealing than the
					&ldquo;statist-quo&rdquo;.
				</p>
				<p>
					The world today is not designed to make your path
					to freedom from government accessible, but rather
					to make the choice to surrender your freedom as
					easy and comfortable as possible. It is filled
					with institutions and ideologies designed to make
					freedom seem impossible in this lifetime and to
					make your time and wealth exploitable by people
					who thrive on your continued lack of freedom and
					lack of hope for such. Thinking that it's
					impossible to achieve freedom. Our job as
					freedom-bringers is to make the agorist path the
					path of least resistance for others. That is,
					freedom-bringers must create a world where freedom
					from taxation and regulation is as accessible as
					possible to others.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each individual can design their life to live with
					intention toward the maximization of freedom in
					this lifetime. This website aims to explore and
					facilitate various ways of life that will bring us
					as close as possible to anarchy in this lifetime.
