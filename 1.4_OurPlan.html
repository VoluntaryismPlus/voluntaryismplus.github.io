				<p>
					The likelihood of a proposal&rsquo;s
					success or failure lies in its
					definition and terms. Because the
					network is a system of ideas that can be
					recreated by anyone who has heard the
					methodology, our proposal is one that
					requires no money and no one person or
					group to bring it through to completion.
					All that is needed is a simple
					redirection of attention and resources
					away from what is unsavory and towards a
					network that will truly provide for us.
				</p>
				<p>
					An idea cannot fail when its success
					does not rely on monetary achievement,
					any one person attaining notoriety for a
					project, or the first iteration of the
					project to see the goal to completion.
					Different projects have failed due to
					definition alone. If the definition of
					success is that one location persists or
					that one group of people survives, the
					plan is not great enough.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyone in the next 100 years could find
					this set of instructions and re-create
					what we are doing now. But there will be
					no need to start from scratch. As soon
					as the number of people are
					proliferating the ideas contained
					herein, there will be more aversions and
					more resiliency because of them. We do
					not need to be attributed to the version
					that succeeds. We will always only be
					one group who saw what was possible. I
					made sure to write down our ideas as we
					lived them out.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your work should be designed so that you
					want it to be stolen. Through
					replication grows notoriety. More people
					exposed means more people knowing it
					exists at all. If one person's desire
					for recognition, for ownership of an
					idea, an entire project can fail to
					launch. Our plan is, among other things,
					to spread to all people the recognition
					of what is possible and what is lacking
					in the current narrative. This will make
					it easier to take responsibility for
					ones own narrative outlook that they
					ultimately share with the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is the workbook for how the world
					succeeds when enough of us choose to do
					so.&nbsp;

				<p>
					We can all imagine ways that a limited
					number of people could take down the
					beast. For example, if all liberty
					minded individuals refused to pay taxes,
					and it became a well known movement,
					then there is a good probability that
					the news would become viral and enough
					people would join in this endeavor to
					defund the governemnt. There are also
					easy ideas for how to operate as a
					society beyond this defunding -
					coordinating with your friends and
					neighbors to show up as a group to the
					scene of a dispute or incident is a
					great example. This is also the concept
					of militia. Strong ubiquitous
					self-defense is how we will defend
					ourselves against foreign or domestic
					threats. We are providing and helping to
					provide whatever extra support systems
					are needed to get the solution going and
					to normalize the conversations around
					the new lexicon of reality and the idea
					of having no overarching government.

				<p>
					We want the option of freedom for all.
					Coersion is something that affects all
					aspects of our lives. We can run away
					into the woods and wait for the laws and
					society to come out and reach us there,
					or we can take actions to make sure the
					larger social structure in which we
					exist becomes less coersive to us over
					time. If your plan doesn&rsquo;t bring
					more freedom to the greater world you
					live within as well as to your private
					world, you are not on the wrong path;
					but we want to help expand your personal
					vision so that you can coexist in a
					network with other like-minded
					individuals. We are adding resources and
					connecting people to resources that
					aren&rsquo;t easily attainable in this
					current world. We believe it is easy to
					add a truly altruistic component to
					freedom when an option is offered that
					is competitive and readily available.
					For too long we have been oppressed by a
					government that does not serve us.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of us have questions such as: Why
					can&rsquo;t my loved ones find a
					community that provides for them instead
					of depleting them? Why can&rsquo;t we
					find affordable local food that
					doesn&rsquo;t fund the state? We have
					the answers for these questions. The
					State itself is unnecessary, and without
					it, we would be able to live as makes
					sense.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Many have the option to move out of the
					toxic cities, get food from local
					sources, and protect themselves far
					beyond the usual defenses such as pepper
					spray and a cell phone. However, some
					can&rsquo;t leave the statist parts of
					their lives as easily based on personal
					or family health conditions, child
					custody issues, or other obligations.
					This will not always be the case,
					however. There will be agorist solutions
					to all of these issues. The more
					resilient and fail-proof our networks
					are, the harder it will be for those in
					control to restrict our actions. There
					will be more and more options available
					and nobody can predict how amazing it
					will turn out.

					required. We are FREE people, are we
					not? We aren&rsquo;t trying to abolish
					the State. If there are people who still
					wish to use a State for provision of
					specific goods or services, they should
					still be free to contract in such ways,
					but again, they in the NEW realm will
					enter into such contracts voluntarily
					and with the free-will choice to say no
					without punishment or retaliation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The idea is to help everyone who is
					having trouble redirecting their income
					stream and expenditures to purely
					agorist sources - so that we can keep
					the wealth in the family and grow a
					system that will stand resolute against
					all threats.
				</p>
				<p>
					We know this will work and we want to
					help form and strengthen the bonds that
					will replace weak supply lines currently
					&ldquo;providing&rdquo; for us. The
					necessity of the State is the story we
					tell ourselves. We can get everyone we
					know to stop telling that story. We are
					building a network of capable people who
					can protect each other and the world. We
					are on voluntary teams that work outside
					of the government.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have a business model that cannot
					fail. The value people are already
					generating can be redirected towards the
					agorist network and thus go much further
					towards true growth and prosperity. This
					enables a lifestyle maximized for
					freedom.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					All interactions we take part in are in
					a free and sovereign world. We are
					taking all transactions out of the city.
					We are making sure the money we spend
					goes towards a system that will protect
					us, not towards a system that will hurt
					us. So every interaction should be taken
					from the government/taxes and utilized
					by only voluntaryists who are making the
					new world.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are creating spaces that you can live
					in free of charge so that you can detox
					for as long as you need. Our network
					provides a means of achieving whatever
					life goals you have in a way that
					doesn&rsquo;t fund wars but actually
					helps others gain security. You will see
					the way in which you can finally align
					yourself with the way you are acting out
					your own real-life adventure. We have a
					way to help you expand your impact on
					those you care about while reducing your
					risk and the risk of those you do
					business with. With our network, you
					have the prospect of real security,
					wealth, privacy, and community. On top
					of all of this, you will witness the
					structure of the world change based on
					your input.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you see what is really possible in
					this moment, in this lifetime, you will
					see the value of embarking on your own
					journey in the Realm. All it takes is
					spreading this knowledge to the people
					who will want to do something about it
					and create the change they want to see.
				</p>
				<p>
					The knowledge of our slavery is hardly
					as important as the knowledge of our
					power and all the tools and manpower
					that we already have at our disposal to
					fight back against tyrants through
					nonviolent, non-confrontational means.

				<p>
					Countless people throughout the world
					are committed to attaining higher levels
					of freedom for themselves, and many are
					also passionate about the freedom of
					others. We already have the
					infrastructure necessary to sustain
					freedom for more and more people right
					now. The thing that has been lacking in
					other plans we see is a simple and
					wide-scale solution. The clear,
					ideologically simple idea of freedom for
					all people without adherence to one
					system or another. The means to
					transition from a state of surviving to
					one of thriving. The Network is here to
					bring the coordination necessary to
					completely defund the systems we do not
					consent to.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a lack of discussion on the
					specifics of how voluntaryism can lead
					from this state to the next state within
					our lifetime.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is good to speak of the unknown
					nature of the polycentric outcomes that
					will take place in a free society.
					However, this does not mean there will
					not be some specific events that lead
					towards the adoption of this new
					world.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					There are enough voluntaryists already
					that if they all did something
					cohesively, the example they made would
					become visible to the larger public.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then it is the actual free nature of
					voluntaryism itself that would enable
					many more people to become aware of the
					efficacy of this way of living.&nbsp;
