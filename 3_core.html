						<strong>Consent-Only Culture</strong>

				<p>
					Voluntaryists adhere to a philosophy based on the
					idea that all human interactions should be
					voluntary. If you take those ideas to their
					conclusion, you are an anarchist. The world we
					envision includes voluntary relations between
					equals, rather than between rulers and subjects.
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h4>
						<em>Without rulers. Not without rules.</em>
					</h4>
				</div>
				<p>
					Anarchy is about individuals deciding for
					themselves how they will interact with the world.
					This does not mean they will be able to oppress or
					aggress upon others without repercussions.
					Voluntaryism is Anarchy because property rights
					and self-ownership are immutable but do not ever
					necessitate coercion or force such as telling
					others what they can and can&rsquo;t do with their
					property. In the current system, do you feel like
					you have control? In a voluntaryist world, there
					is no legal way to aggress against others, and you
					are free to determine the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; over
					your own property.
				</p>
				<p>
					We define evil as the destruction of freedom. A
					choice for the lesser of two evils is still a
					choice for evil and will always result in evil.
					You never have to choose evil. Just like the
					trajectory of all evil is more evil, the
					trajectory of all tyrants, both big and small, is
					more tyranny. The ends don&rsquo;t justify the
					means. The means and the end are the same. Freedom
					must be taken.

						<strong>Decentralization:</strong>
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Decisions are best made by the people who are
					affected by a decision. There are no &ldquo;one
					size fits all&rdquo; solutions that work best for
					most people. Such &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; are
					usually only made possible through compulsion. The
					best solution for everyone seeking a voluntary and
					peaceful world is to resist and refuse
					involuntary, compulsive strategies while being
					tolerant and supportive (or at the very least not
					opposed to) societies consisting of only
					pluralities of competing voluntary peaceful
					offerings and solutions to meet the needs of
					individuals.

          <h3>Moral Philosophy vs Political Philosophy

						<strong>We already live in anarchy.</strong>

				</div>
				<p>
					Most of us are already Voluntaryists and we all
					already live in a state of anarchy. We live in
					anarchy now. We define having
					&ldquo;authority&rdquo; as having power over and
					the right to exercise that power over someone or
					something. There is no such thing as authority
					beyond the self because no one has the right to
					exercise their will against another&rsquo;s will.
					We are free to act as we like. The game of rulers
					and subjects is just a story we tell ourselves. We
					are hindered by the people called the police force
					(see our section on voluntary means of
					defense).&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					We can become more free from government bullying
					by building alternate networks of free people.
					&ldquo;Government/<em>the state</em>&rdquo; is the
					belief that some people can possess authority
					(power and the right to exercise it) over other
					people. The belief that some of us are rulers
					while the rest of us are subjects and must obey is
					a story people tell themselves. Some people stand
					up and defy tyrants. Luckily, resisting tyranny
					does not require violence or aggression.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are providing opportunities and options so that
					people don&rsquo;t have to seek services that the
					proceeds from are going towards the government and
					people who also drain their resources to the
					government; granting them lesser autonomy<em>
						and the perpetuation of the under-supplied
						agorist market.</em
