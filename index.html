					<h4>
						<em
							>You&rsquo;ve stumbled upon an unstoppable and
							actionable strategy for freedom.</em
						>
					</h4>
				</div>
				<p>
					Given we are all equal in rights, what is wrong
					for one is wrong for all. This basic truth applied
					consistently results in a world where all goods,
					services, Guilds, institutions, interactions, etc.
					are voluntary.
				</p>
				<p>
					A moral principle or code must be universally
					applicable and unchanging. That said, many large
					institutions of this world seek to obfuscate and
					seduce us into accepting that some human beings
					get to act as if they have rights they do not.
					Because we have allowed our world to get to the
					current state of human emergency, a solution must
					be pioneered out of a life of subjugation through
					compulsory taxes and compulsory regulation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most are convinced that the rules of the game we
					call our current society are immutable. They
					believe that even if there are unjust laws, the
					only option is to obey and self-enforce those
					laws. This way of thinking is based in fear of the
					repercussions of acting outside of the boundaries
					of our current system. This fear is understandable
					when there is not a well-known tradition and
					pathway towards living a life unfettered by unjust
					laws.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each individual is an owner in themselves and has
					the right to choose who they will and will not
					associate with, pay tribute to, or be subject to.
					This simple understanding constitutes the
					framework from which we have built our moral code
					of conduct. You cannot delegate rights you don't
					have. No individual nor group of individuals can
					decide for another person what they consent to.
					You do not have the right to enslave, rob, or
					murder another individual, but in this society,
					many pretend to delegate these "rights" none of us
					possess to individuals called "elected officials"
					and their enforcers called "police" and their
					monopolized injustice system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Acknowledging these facts can cause complex
					emotions regarding the current state of the world.
					Unlike what we are led to believe, we are not
					powerless to change this world and our lives for
					the better. We choose to rally around a common
					cause as opposed to a common enemy. Freedom, to
					us, is not only about not being bound by the
					current monstrous systems. Freedom is also
					measured by the ability to conduct your
					consensual, voluntary affairs as you see fit
					without repercussions.
				</p>
				<p>
					On an individual level, our lifestyle allows us to
					remove ourselves from many of the unnecessary
					taxes and regulations on our lives that most
					people suffer from, and our goal is to pioneer,
					provision access to, and foster a parallel
					network, a way of life, and counter-economy of
					morally-conscious individuals.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are still countless voluntary paths and
					professions that are blocked by the current
					system. It should be easy and available for anyone
					to enter into a profession they desire, or to
					create an entirely new profession for themselves
					without unnecessary bloated restrictions, allowing
					for the free market to deliver goods and services
					based on consumer desires. There is a way forward,
					and we are the ones to create it.
				</p>

						<strong>What is the problem?</strong>
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Why do we not have another option when it comes to
					where we get our food, goods, and numerous other
					services? Why is there not a huge supply of
					untaxed, unregulated grey and black market goods,
					with countless supply lines providing a robust and
					healthy market for those who wish to get their
					needs met through non-government channels? Other
					countries have this to varying degrees, but there
					has to be a reason why the "United States" has yet
					to provide this service.
				</p>
				<p>
					The major reason why more farmers don’t work
					outside of the government system is fear. They
					have a healthy fear that they will be found and
					punished if they go against “the law” (aka “the
					lie”). Our mission is to make it possible for
					farmers, agorists, and anyone seeking to free
					themselves from taxes or regulations to sell
					without fear of government persecution.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span
						>There is a common perception that in order to
						be “doing agorism”, one has to be disconnected
						from social media and other forms of
						communication. We recognize the value of privacy
						and support those who wish to remain
						disconnected, but there is also great value in
						having a public-interfacing faction of the
						network aimed at growing and upgrading the
						network of individuals who recognize the true
						nature of the State and of all who seek to
						restrict the freedom to peacefully conduct
						oneself with other consenting individuals, the
						right to freedom of association, the right of
						self-defense, and the right to restitution for
						damages done to the person or property of the
						individual unless the damage was inflicted in
						self-defense.</span
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span
						>There will have to be a group of people who are
						putting themselves on the line in order to grow
						the network. We are not trying to make a network
						that is insular and inaccessible to outsiders.
						We need to create something that is both safe
						and widespread, as the survival of the network
						relies on its dispersed nature, not on one
						branch becoming large and noticeable and thus
						susceptible to being torn down. This benefits
						the market and every individual in it as it is
						imperative to have multiple sources of goods and
						services to create resilient, decentralized, and
						redundant networks.</span
					>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3><strong>What is the solution?</strong></h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Our solution is to create a decentralized network
					which will grow the freedom, wealth, and
					resiliency of everyone involved through the use of
					<a href="1.2_IntroVoluntaryism.html#section3"
						>Agorism</a
					>.
				</p>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="img/Agorism.png" />
				</div>
				<p>
					Right now, there is not a steady supply of goods
					available that doesn&rsquo;t fund the tax system.
					This means that most farms and companies get
					licenses and follow regulations that cost them and
					their customers money in taxes that do not support
					the common person but that instead fund wars and
					other atrocities.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					We are creating an alternate path that every
					person can take to follow their calling. All
					vocations and professions are needed in this new
					realm. The thing that is missing currently is the
					guarantee that if one takes their business out of
					the current system, there will be certain and
					sufficient accessible demand for the agorist goods
					and services provided.
				</p>
				<p>
					The demand does exist, but there is not an easy
					way to locate consumers. We are alleviating this
					by using our lives to create connections between
					consumers and producers and free marketplaces for
					them to do business in.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similarly, those who would seek goods and services
					do not have a clear-cut way to find them at a
					competitive or even comparable value to what is
					available through the current compulsory system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Decentralization is imperative. One of the results
					of decentralization is that no one person is
					spearheading the movement. Any one farmer doesn’t
					have to grow their operation to the extent that
					they become a target.
				</p>
				<p>
					Decentralization means that there is not a
					monopoly over the food supply. Rather, there are
					countless sources of goods and services available.
					Having more sources provides a contingency plan
					for if anything happens to one or more supply
					lines. More sources allow for individuals to have
					more choices between products and they are able to
					choose based on the business practices of those
					that produce them.

					This is how a nomadic caravan's contribution will
					look:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">
						<ul>
							<li>
								One or more full time traveling caravans are
								formed.
							</li>
							<li>
								A caravan sets up a pop-up agorist
								marketplace on the outskirts of a city for
								approximately one month at a time.
							</li>
							<li>
								People from the caravan enter the city and
								spread the word through a variety of
								networking and advertising techniques about
								the alternate marketplace and offer
								opportunities for alternative ways of
								living. This is not unlike setting up camp
								on the outskirts of an enemy-occupied and
								controlled city, town, or village you wish
								to wage economic war with.
							</li>
							<li>
								The caravan leaves behind a full-time group
								committed to holding marketplaces and
								helping those in the city transition into a
								full-time agorist lifestyle.
							</li>

						<p>
							An example of a nomadic agorist network is
							<a href="caravanarchy.html"
								>Camp CaravAnarchy</a
							>, a traveling nomadic agorist caravan that
							focuses on making business and social networks
							with people seeking to bring about a more free

						<p>
							Our
							<a href="chewsabout.html"
								>&ldquo;Ice Cream Philosophy&rdquo;</a

							is that we strive to bring to market the
							finest quality Homemade Ice Cream products,
							sourcing ingredients from as many agorist

						</p>
					</div>
					<br />
				</div>
				<br />
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>The Market Circuit</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					We are creating a perpetual free market that will
					provide a safe space for people to buy and sell
					agorist goods without fear of the government. We
					travel from town to town, setting up in BLM land,
					staying for a month or more at a time, and from
					time to time venturing to private campgrounds for
					freedom-respecting festivals.
				</p>
				<p>
					We don’t need to convince more people that this
					way of living is viable. There are already enough
					people who have seen the vision of how a free and
					voluntary society would work - if every one of
					them started living their life in this new way, we
					would make a big enough impact to gain the
					attention of the rest of the world. This is not
					another intentional community. This is a strategy
					towards creating freedom for all that can be
					adopted by every person immediately. There is no
					central location or leader that can be taken down.
					Like an idea, it can only spread.

											Voluntaryism is the moral philosophy

											use of force is defensive force. We
											abide by the Non-Aggression Principle
											(NAP) which dictates that no action be
											taken that violates another’s consent

					<h2>Freedom, in This Lifetime</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					You do not need to try to create the new paradigm
					from scratch in your current location or local
					community. To bring about the best of all possible
					worlds, where everyone has access to a free and
					fulfilling way of life, you must find those who
					already agree with your values and vision no
					matter where they might reside. Instead of trying
					to influence a lifestyle change in those still
					resistant to the idea of protected free
					communities, you can combine your efforts with
					those who share your intentions and who already
					see the vision of what is possible in this
					lifetime. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You could spend a lifetime trying to persuade
					others to see the vision themselves and then to
					become active in changing their own lives. But
					there is a quicker way to achieve freedom. Network
					with people who already understand that freedom
					from the existing lies, taxes, and restrictions on
					peaceful activity is needed, and grow resilient
					trade networks with those individuals toward that
					shared goal. This is called agorism, and this
					website is a guide to creating this in your own
					life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though some people have the drive and desire to be
					leaders at the forefront of a dispersed community
					that values and protects their freedom to
					peacefully interact and transact without
					repercussions, we can&rsquo;t wait for those
					people to come out of the woodwork to begin
					creating a new free way of living. Word of mouth
					takes time to propagate. Most people can&rsquo;t
					be expected to change when there isn&rsquo;t an
					obvious and well-worn path towards a new way of
					living.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Creating a new world will require a relatively
					small dispersed group of people who not only are
					interested in a new world but who are prepared to
					take action in their lives to create an alternate
					network of agorists aimed at creating this
					ecosystem for each other, replacing streams of
					resources from the exploitative system with the
					networked goods and services of protected free
					markets. This does not mean an end to the
					importation and production of goods, but simply to
					better sources of them. Sources that do not, for
					example, fund the war machine, enslavement, and
					mass incarceration of human beings.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Until this alternative network becomes more
					ubiquitous, it will be hard for individuals to
					abandon their current lifestyle and transfer all
					their income and expenditures over to these free
					and ethical sources. There are already people
					spread out across the country and world who are
					prepared to make that shift in a way that creates
					more opportunities for everyone seeking a free way
					of life.
				</p>
				<div class="imglt">
					<img src="img/collaboration.jpeg" />
				</div>

				<p>
					The larger community is made up of individuals who
					have the skills and knowledge necessary to support
					one another. What support does the individual need
					from a network? Every good or service you spend
					money on can be re-sourced. Medical care,
					insurance, gasoline, jobs, and education to name a
					few. Everything that drives the world today can be
					provided in a better way by the community.

						<strong>Making The Switch</strong>

				</div>
				<p>
					We do not need to escape this world. We have
					everything we need here to create the next phase
					of existence. This is the world that, in time,
					becomes the ideal world for each individual. How
					can each person have their own ideal coexisting
					with every other person&rsquo;s ideal,
					simultaneously? The answer is voluntary pluralism.
				</p>
				<p>
					To get a more concise and potent result, we are
					more concise with our parameters. We are not
					judging those who do not follow these parameters,
					but we are making a distinction within our own
					decisions to do business with others who are
					actively creating more freedom for others instead
					of creating only a space for themselves to
					temporarily reduce their own oppression while
					doing little to manifest or support protected free
					markets.

				<div class="headerbox">

					</h4>
				</div>
				<p>
					We do not want to spend our lives working for
					other people&rsquo;s goals while doing nothing or
					very little toward what we are in this realm to
					achieve, which has nothing to do with slaving away
					for money.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a guide to the establishment of a society
					that is independent, interconnected, and free from
					coercion. Today, we have everything we need to
					circumvent the state entirely. Communities small
					and large are already flourishing all around the
					world, and what is lacking in the common lore is a
					larger and more liberating story we can all
					manifest into reality.&nbsp;

				</div>
				<p>
					Understanding what is possible will lead to a more
					extensive awareness and empowered utilization of
					these communities, both with each other and by
					those still more entrenched in the slave society.

					<em
						>The worst evil is people still believing and
						perpetuating the lie that their neighbors must
						be controlled by the government. No individual
						or group of individuals can possess authority,
						or “the right to rule”, over others. You own
						your self and 100% of the fruits of your time
						and labor, which can be thought of as an
						extension of yourself on this planet.</em
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					Our plan is to provide people with options to
					transfer their work and living situations into a
					new realm or state of existence where they are not
					bound by government systems of control.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your way of living should be an act of rebellion
					that helps make people’s choice for freedom a
					no-brainer.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have a method to support and bolster the supply
					of goods and services by providing an ever-growing
					supply and demand for these resources. This is
					accomplished through intentional networking and
					establishing trade relationships and contracts
					with individuals who share our aim of bringing
					about the best of all possible worlds by making
					the world more free for others. We also aim to
					minimize if not eliminate altogether the number of
					fiscal transactions we engage in with unknown or
					unvetted individuals, especially those who haven’t
					demonstrated a desire to be free from the taxes
					and regulations imposed on them by the State.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many ways in which this plan is unique
					to any we have seen so far. The unique attributes
					of our plan provide a strength and resilience that
					helps it transcend the pitfalls of other
					initiatives and businesses. Unlike a proposal that
					requires massive funding to get off the ground, we
					already have much of the infrastructure needed in
					place. All that is needed is to transition
					businesses that are funding the tax system into
					the new, free realm. There are no extra start up
					costs to create a business in the network - no
					fancy degrees or licenses are needed. Vending,
					selling, trading, and providing your good or
					service is free of compulsory licensure or fees.
					This initiative is aimed at people who are already
					trying to make a living and who already have
					resources invested in themselves and could benefit
					from shifting their business towards a tax-free
					network that will provide them with opportunities
					for growth, a greater sense of purpose and
					connection with their customers, and lasting
					prosperity.
				</p>
				<p>
					What we are describing is a lifestyle and
					resource-allocation strategy. The more people are
					empowered by these strategies, the stronger they
					become and the more everyone involved benefits.
					The success of the network is not tied to any
					individual’s success. We (Caravanarchy) identify
					as “network support”. Others can replace our role
					should some tragedy befall our specific wing of
					support.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Success looks like a network that can provide
					people with what they need to make their lives
					better in the absence of compulsory fees or
					restrictions getting between suppliers and
					customers. This results in alternate income
					streams, careers, training, and education. A
					multitude of options of superior value become
					available from this strategy when it comes to
					food, supplies, and services. Alternate
					healthcare, insurance, arbitration as well as
					alternate entertainment venues and community
					meeting spaces become available to more
					individuals as the network grows.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are creating this guidebook and an online
					presence that will do much more to help those
					specific individuals who want to make a change and
					commit to these endeavors in a way that makes a
					difference. Join us in creating a world immune
					from institutionalized tyranny!

				</div>
				<p>
					This is a guide outlining the scope of what is
					possible in the next 1-10 years. This is not a
					guide on how to create a voluntaryist society
					starting where you are with only the resources
					present in your local community.
				</p>
				<p>
					Spreading freedom (and a voluntaryist society)
					requires that you first take care of your personal
					need for autonomy and freedom. It will also
					require intentional choices aimed at both starving
					and bleeding our primary enemy (the State) of
					resources and power while supporting and
					bolstering your allies and friends in freedom.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first step is to ascertain whether relocation
					or nomadic living might be the most lucrative way
					to achieve your short-term goals while
					transitioning out of the non-agorist system (<a
						href="1.2_IntroVoluntaryism.html#section3"
						><em>What is Agorism?</em></a
					>). There are locations available for short or
					long-term living rent and work-free while you
					detox from society or re-evaluate your goals.
					These are voluntary spaces, both nomadic and
					stationary, which take shape depending on the
					unanimous consent of the people who reside there.
				</p>
				<p>
					We seek these spaces out on our journeys, so that
					everywhere we go, we can direct you to them. As
					time progresses, these spaces will transform. For
					example, a property with no development on it can
					be used to sustain people who just need a place to
					stay. If multiple people live there, the cost of
					living can be very small because you only need one
					vehicle to get food and water. Working together,
					we can use free and natural materials to build
					shelters. These properties can produce exports
					that nomadic travelers can sell for them along
					their travels.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you would like to open up a space for this
					purpose, let us know.

					Some say that a better future starts with an
					internal change - that you must start with
					yourself to make the world a better place. We
					don’t think one person’s actions alone are enough
					to create change at the scale needed to achieve
					our objective. In order to extend your range of
					influence and exercise your power to create
					change, you need to skip trying to change other
					people’s minds and instead connect to others who
					already see the way forward to make a change.
				</p>
				<p>
					Networking with other freedom-seekers and
					expanding your social circles and trade options is
					the most effective way of creating the best of all
					possible worlds. We know this is the way to create
					the best of all possible worlds because it permits
					everyone to choose how to spend their time and
					resources without third parties imposing
					themselves on their free-will choices. You can’t
					change someone’s mind or make them advance
					spiritually or mentally in a way they are not
					ready to. But you can give people a better option
					to spend their hard earned resources and time on.
					This enables them to have more resources to pursue
					what makes them truly happy while also assuring
					themselves a better future.
				</p>
				<p>
					This entire endeavor is focused on real solutions
					and pulling anarchists out of the current paradigm
					and placing them in the situations they need,
					regardless of the resources or money they have
					amassed as of yet in the zombie system. It’s not
					too hard to opt-out if you have enough support.
					This network is providing the extra support needed
					by those who don’t already have a group of
					individuals bolstering their efforts to bring
					about a free and thriving existence for themselves
					and others.

					<h2>How You Can Spread Freedom</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					We support people in translating their lifestyle
					away from the tax system and into the network. In
					order to fully detach, you must reclaim your
					income, housing, business and expenditures. There
					are many resources on this site to help you
					transition into a new life. You can start
					<a href="3.2_StartHere.html">here</a>
					or keep reading to get the full picture.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are not ready to transition in one or more
					of these areas, you can still spread freedom where
					you are by employing the following strategies.
				</p>
				<p>
					This also applies to individuals who do not want
					to leave their current area but still wants to
					grow the network around them.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">
						<h4>Freedom Through Goods and Services</h4>
						<p>
							If you want to spread freedom in your area,
							start by identifying a need people have for a
							good or service and find someone who is
							willing to meet that need. Work with that
							person to create a model where they are able
							to produce a good or provide a service at a
							cost and value that is comparable to the
							market rate but without funding or complying
							with the state in any way.
						</p>
						<br />
						<h4>Freedom Through Housing</h4>
						<p>
							Find ways of circumventing the state through
							providing tax-free shelter for those who are
							also actively trying to create and grow the
							network. The easiest way to do this is to
							create a caravan outside of a city or town
							where the caravan members support each other
							in taking advantage of the amenities of the
							city or town. Members can earn income remotely
							or through interactions with the people of the
							town.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can also create an
							<a href="“innercity.html”">inner-city</a> or
							<a href="“outercity.html”"
								>outer-city outpost</a
							>
							to support visiting caravans and provide a way
							out for people still stuck in the system.
						</p>
						<p>
							A third option would be to become a
							<a href="4.3_NetworkHosts.html"
								>Network Host</a
							>
							and help those trying to gain a new position
							in the network.
						</p>
						<br />
						<h4>Grow Your Network</h4>
						<p>
							The most effective way to grow your network is
							to find people both local and remote to
							collaborate with on creating new offerings in
							the network.
						</p>
						<p>
							To find these contacts, you can search within
							the network via the options on this page:<br />
						</p>
						<h5 style="text-align: center">
							<a href="connections.html"
								>Connections Page</a
							>
						</h5>
						<p>
							To source new contacts in your area, spread
							word of the network with those you meet.
							Identify others who are looking for ways to be
							more free. This includes both friends in
							freedom and trusted individuals who are both
							trade and social contacts.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can also create meetups and marketspaces
							to discuss options, form and execute plans,
							and conduct trade with those who attend. If
							nomadic, such spaces should be created when
							possible, or you can locate a preexisting
							space near you to make contact and trade with
							others in the network. If stationary, the aim
							is to have a regular network meeting and
							market space available near you.

					Keeping the Money in the Network
				</h3>
				<p>
					If you want to trade or give, put your resources
					into people who will make us all more free. When
					you provide goods or services to others, what does
					your energy and time result in? Does it go into a
					network whose growth directly helps and protects
					you, or do your efforts end up funding the state
					down the line?
				</p>
				<p>
					To answer the above question, it is imperative
					that you consider your business contacts and
					customer base. When those you work and do business
					with go back into their lives, are they using the
					energy produced by your trade to create more
					freedom for others? Or are they spending their
					time working within the confines of the State,
					bleeding their energy into its evil machinery
					through their income, housing and other
					interactions?
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="calloutcenter">
						<p>
							When choosing who to sell to or buy from, ask
							yourself:<br />
							"Who is going to be a targeted missile
							directed towards what I would like to
							achieve?"
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					It makes more sense to provide goods and services
					to people who are keeping their energy inside the
					network so that the wealth and prosperity we all
					share can be multiplied instead of pilfered away
					into the enemy’s reserves.
				</p>
				<p>
					When we work within the private realm and don’t
					spend our resources on government licenses and
					taxes, there are more resources concentrated
					within the Network of freedom-bringers. This
					brings the price for Network goods down, making
					them more accessible and allows them a competitive
					advantage over the Matrix market. Networks can
					provide these high-value goods and services to
					those still stuck in the Matrix, introducing them
					to the abundance of the Network without requiring
					them to understand the philosophy. This results in
					stronger, larger agorist networks and market
					opportunities.
				</p>
				<h3 style="margin: 23px 0 5px 0">Charity</h3>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="calloutcenter">
						<p>
							Everything you do is effort and resources.
							Nothing you possess has been received free
							from effort.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Be discerning when you offer help to someone. It
					does the most good to help people who are using
					their life to achieve the greatest good, which is
					making the world more free for themselves and
					others.
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s too much of a risk to spend money or give to
					charity when you cannot ensure it won’t bleed back
					into the State. This includes giving to
					individuals who aren’t making the world more free
					for others. If you give to someone without knowing
					what that person is doing with their resources,
					you are saying “I don’t matter. My time doesn’t
					matter and my efforts are for nothing”. Money can
					be thought of as a source of potential energy, and
					you get to choose toward what potential that
					energy will support.
				</p>
				<p>
					You only have one moment, and endless options for
					where to put your time, energy and resources. If
					you want to grow a network that will become
					prosperous and protect your future, support those
					whose actions lead towards freedom and prosperity
					for all instead of towards making themselves more
					comfortable within a cage.
				</p>
				<p>
					Everyone you give to can be seen as a river of
					potential. If you toss resources into a river,
					throw them into one that leads to freedom for
					others instead of towards apathy and inaction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vote with your wallet. Create the world you want
					to see. It doesn’t help in our economic war
					against the State to give energy or resources to
					people who aren’t trying to make the world more
					free for others. There are people who want a
					better option and who see that there is a need to
					put their money into a network that ensures the
					safety of their person, property, and freedom. The
					Network provides them with an option that they
					desperately need. This is a network that is able
					to protect their physical security and the
					products of their labor in a way that is missing
					in the current paradigm.

						<h4>Needless Division</h4>
						<p>
							Do not discriminate against people unless they
							are working to reduce human freedom. If you
							have a different opinion than someone, look at
							whether their opinion requires others to lose
							their freedom. If you are not sure, ask them
							directly where they draw their line between
							what they will or won't allow from those who

					How Many People Are Ready for This?
				</h3>
				<p>
					If you are worried about the number of people who
					already want a change, we have a few examples for
					you to consider.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consider the unvaccinated. There is a
					misconception among those who supported the jab
					that people who did not want to get vaccinated are
					conservative or Trumpers. That is not the case.
					There are plenty of conservatives who took the jab
					and Trump was the president that pushed them to do
					it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Instead, be heartened by the fact that these are
					people who have now seen how far the government
					will go to restrict people from their jobs,
					hospitals, traveling, and gathering together.
					These people see the need to have a network of
					people to protect and provide solutions in a
					situation where people are barred from buying food
					in a supermarket or entering businesses or common
					spaces without complying in some way.

						CaravAnarchy is the first caravan of this kind
						that we are aware of, although others have
						employed various aspects of it. We have 4
						vehicles and the mobile camping infrastructure
						setup available so we can share the options
						available to us from having access to tools and
						infrastructure to support a loose, slow-moving
						caravan with the aim of ending slavery today
						through education, bolstering and establishing
						agorism and encouraging the connection between
						new and already made alternative networks. We
						offer immediate access to a free way of living
						and exploring what it means to exist and grow in
						the most authentic and empowered expression of
						yourself.
					</p>
					<p>
						We aim to engage in agorist business and
						networking in the towns and cities we travel
						through. Presently, CaravAnarchy funds itself
						through donations and through multiple agorist
						business options we are equipped to employ. The
						aim is to create a marketplace every time we get
						to a new location, at which people in the nearby
						area can conduct their commerce in a safe and
						flourishing space. As traveling nomads,
						CaravAnarchy’s members do not share in the same
						debt-based lifestyle as most stationary peoples.
						This means members require fewer resources to
						sustain a happy, flourishing, and growth-based
						way of life with an abundance of time at your
