<h1 id="section0">Welcome to The Network</h1>
	<div class="innersection"><div class="headerbox"><h4><em>You&rsquo;ve stumbled upon an unstoppable and actionable strategy for freedom.</em></h4></div>
		<p>Given we are all equal in rights, what is wrong for one is
			wrong for all. This basic truth applied consistently results
			in a world where all goods, services, associations,
			institutions, interactions, etc. are voluntary. </p>
		<p>A moral principle or code must be universally applicable
			and unchanging. That said, many large institutions of 
			this world seek to obfuscate and seduce us into accepting
			that some human beings get to act as if they have rights
			they do not. Because we have allowed our world to get to
			the current state of human emergency, a solution must be
			pioneered out of a life of subjugation through compulsory
			taxes and compulsory regulation.</p>
		<p>Most are convinced that the rules of the game we call our current society are immutable. They believe that even if there are unjust laws, the only option is to obey and self-enforce those laws. This way of thinking is based in fear of the repercussions of acting outside of the boundaries of our current system. This fear is understandable when there is not a well-known tradition and pathway towards living a life unfettered by unjust laws.</p>
		<p>Each individual is an owner in themselves and has the right to choose who they will and will not associate with, pay tribute to, or be subject to. This simple understanding constitutes the framework from which we have built our moral code of conduct. You cannot delegate rights you don't have. No individual nor group of individuals can decide for another person what they consent to. You do not have the right to enslave, rob, or murder another individual, but in this society, many pretend to delegate these "rights" none of us possess to individuals called "elected officials" and their enforcers called "police" and their monopolized injustice system.</p>
		<p>Acknowledging these facts can cause complex emotions regarding the current state of the world. Unlike what we are led to believe, we are not powerless to change this world and our lives for the better. We choose to rally around a common cause as opposed to a common enemy. Freedom, to us, is not only about not being bound by the current monstrous systems. Freedom is also measured by the ability to conduct your consensual, voluntary affairs as you see fit without repercussions.</p>
		<p>On an individual level, our lifestyle allows us to remove ourselves from many of the unnecessary taxes and regulations on our lives that most people suffer from, and our goal is to pioneer, provision access to, and foster a parallel network, a way of life, and counter-economy of morally-conscious individuals.</p>
		<p>There are still countless voluntary paths and professions that are blocked by the current system. It should be easy and available for anyone to enter into a profession they desire, or to create an entirely new profession for themselves without unnecessary bloated restrictions, allowing for the free market to deliver goods and services based on consumer desires. There is a way forward, and we are the ones to create it.</p>
	</div>
<div class="outerimage"><img src="img/network1.jpeg"></div>
<div class="innersection"><div class="headerbox"><h3 id="section0.1"><strong>What is the problem?</strong></h3></div>
<p>Why do we not have another option when it comes to where we get our food, goods, and numerous other services? Why is there not a huge supply of untaxed, unregulated grey and black market goods, with countless supply lines providing a robust and healthy market for those who wish to get their needs met through non-government channels? Other countries have this to varying degrees, but there has to be a reason why the "United States" has yet to provide this service.</p>
<p>The major reason why more farmers don’t work outside of the government system is fear. They have a healthy fear that they will be found and punished if they go against “the law” (aka “the lie”). Our mission is to make it possible for farmers, agorists, and anyone seeking to free themselves from taxes or regulations to sell without fear of government persecution.</p>
<p><span>There is a common perception that in order to be “doing agorism”, one has to be disconnected from social media and other forms of communication.  We recognize the value of privacy and support those who wish to remain disconnected, but there is also great value in having a public-interfacing faction of the network aimed at growing and upgrading the network of individuals who recognize the true nature of the State and of all who seek to restrict the freedom to peacefully conduct oneself with other consenting individuals, the right to freedom of association, the right of self-defense, and the right to restitution for damages done to the person or property of the individual unless the damage was inflicted in self-defense.</span></p>
<p><span>There will have to be a group of people who are putting themselves on the line in order to grow the network. We are not trying to make a network that is insular and inaccessible to outsiders. We need to create something that is both safe and widespread, as the survival of the network relies on its dispersed nature, not on one branch becoming large and noticeable and thus susceptible to being torn down. This benefits the market and every individual in it as it is imperative to have multiple sources of goods and services to create resilient, decentralized, and redundant networks.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="innersection"><div class="headerbox"><h3><strong>What is the solution?</strong></h3></div>
		<p>Our solution is to create a decentralized network which will grow the freedom, wealth, and resiliency of everyone involved through the use of <a href="1.2_IntroVoluntaryism.html#section3">Agorism</a>.</p> 
		<div class="image"><img src="img/Agorism.png"></div> 
	<p>Right now, there is not a steady supply of goods available that 
		doesn&rsquo;t fund the tax system. This means that most farms 
		and companies get licenses and follow regulations that cost 
		them and their customers money in taxes that do not support 
		the common person but that instead fund wars and other atrocities.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>We are creating an alternate path that every person can take 
		to follow their calling. All vocations and professions are 
		needed in this new realm. The thing that is missing currently 
		is the guarantee that if one takes their business out of the 
		current system, there will be certain and sufficient accessible 
		demand for the agorist goods and services provided.</p>
	<p>The demand does exist, but there is not an easy way to locate 
		consumers.</p>
	<p>Similarly, those who would seek goods and services do not have a 
		clear-cut way to find them at a competitive or even comparable 
		value to what is available through the current compulsory system.</p>
	<p>Decentralization is imperative. One of the results of decentralization 
		is that no one person is spearheading the movement. Any one farmer 
		doesn’t have to grow their operation to the extent that they become 
		a target.</p>
	<p>Decentralization means that there is not a monopoly over the food supply. 
		Rather, there are countless sources of goods and services available. 
		Having more sources provides a contingency plan for if anything happens 
		to one or more supply lines. More sources allow for individuals to have 
		more choices between products and they are able to choose based on the 
		business practices of those that produce them.<p/>

	<p>This is how a nomadic caravan's contribution will look:</p>
	<div class="callout">
		<div class="callouttext">
			<ul>
				<li>One or more full time traveling caravans are formed.</li>
				<li>A caravan sets up a pop-up agorist marketplace on the outskirts 
					of a city for approximately one month at a time. </li>
				<li>People from the caravan enter the city and spread the word 
					through a variety of networking and advertising techniques
					about the alternate marketplace and offer opportunities for alternative 
					ways of living. This is not unlike setting up camp on the outskirts of an
					enemy-occupied and controlled city, town, or village 
				you wish to wage economic war with.</li>
				<li>The caravan leaves behind a full-time group committed to holding 
					marketplaces and helping those in the city transition into a full-time 
					agorist lifestyle.</li>
			</ul>

	<div class="callout">

		<h3 class="callouttitle">CaravAnarchy</h3></a>
		<div class="callouttext">
			<div class="calloutimage"><img src="img/tent1.JPEG"></div>
			<p>An example of a nomadic agorist 
			network is <a href="caravanarchy.html">Camp CaravAnarchy</a>,
			a traveling nomadic agorist caravan that focuses on 
			making business and social networks with people seeking
			to bring about a more free way of living for themselves 
			and others.</p>

<div class="callout">
	<a href="chewshome.html"><h3 class="callouttitle">Chew&rsquo;s Wisely Ice Cream and Pizza</h3></a>
	<div class="callouttext">
		<div class="calloutimage"><img src="img/toppings.jpeg"></div>
		<p>Our <a href="chewsabout.html">&ldquo;Ice Cream Philosophy&rdquo;</a> 
			is that we strive to bring to market the finest quality
			Homemade Ice Cream products, sourcing ingredients from 
			as many agorist sources as possible, sourcing only the 
			highest quality ingredients.&nbsp; If you want access 
			to the best Ice Cream this reality has to offer, you 
			have to go through the agorist market.</p>
		</div>
	<br>
</div><br>
<div class="headerbox"><h3>The Market Circuit</h3></div>
		<p>We are creating a perpetual free market that will provide
			a safe space for people to buy and sell agorist goods 
			without fear of the government. We travel from town
			to town, setting up in BLM land, staying for a month or
			more at a time, and from time to time venturing to private
			campgrounds for freedom-respecting festivals.</p>
    	<p>We don’t need to convince more people that this way of 
			living is viable. There are already enough people who 
			have seen the vision of how a free and voluntary society 
			would work - if every one of them started living their
			life in this new way, we would make a big enough impact
			to gain the attention of the rest of the world. 
			This is not another intentional community. This is a 
			strategy towards creating freedom for all that can be
			adopted by every person immediately. There is no central
			location or leader that can be taken down. Like an idea,
			it can only spread. </p>

	<div class="headerbox"><h2>Freedom, in This Lifetime</h2></div>
	<p>You do not need to try to create the new paradigm from scratch
		in your current location or local community. To bring about
		the best of all possible worlds, where everyone has access to
		a free and fulfilling way of life, you must find those who 
		already agree with your values and vision no matter where they
		might reside. Instead of trying to influence a lifestyle change
		in those still resistant to the idea of protected free 
		communities, you can combine your efforts with those who share
		your intentions and who already see the vision of what is
		possible in this lifetime. </p>
<p>You could spend a lifetime trying to persuade others to see the 
	vision themselves and then to become active in changing their own
	lives. But there is a quicker way to achieve freedom. Network 
	with people who already understand that freedom from the existing
	lies, taxes, and restrictions on peaceful activity is needed, and
	grow resilient trade networks with those individuals toward that
	shared goal. This is called agorism, and this website is a guide 
	to creating this in your own life.</p>
	<p>Though some people have the drive and desire to
	be at the forefront of a dispersed community that values and 
	protects their freedom to peacefully interact and transact without
	repercussions, we can&rsquo;t wait for those people to come out of
	the woodwork to begin creating a new free way of living. Word of 
	mouth takes time to propagate. Most people can&rsquo;t be expected
	to change when there isn&rsquo;t an obvious and well-worn path 
	towards a new way of living.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating a new world will require a relatively small dispersed group
	of people who not only are interested in a new world but who are 
	prepared to take action in their lives to create an alternate network
	of agorists aimed at creating this ecosystem for each other, replacing
	streams of resources from the exploitative system with the networked 
	goods and services of protected free markets. This does not mean an 
	end to the importation and production of goods, but simply to better
	sources of them. Sources that do not, for example, fund the war machine,
	enslavement, and mass incarceration of human beings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until this alternative network becomes more ubiquitous, it will be hard 
	for individuals to abandon their current lifestyle and transfer 
	all their income and expenditures over to these free and ethical 
	sources. There are already people spread out across the country and 
	world who are prepared to make that shift in a way that creates more
	opportunities for everyone seeking a free way of life.</p>
	<div class="imglt"><img src="img/collaboration.jpeg"></div>

<p>The larger community is made up of individuals who have the skills 
	and knowledge necessary to support one another. What support does 
	the individual need from a network? Every good or service you spend
	money on can be re-sourced. Medical care, insurance, gasoline, jobs,
	and education to name a few. Everything that drives the world today
	can be provided in a better way by the community.</p>
</div>
<div class="outerimage"><img src="img/collaboration.jpeg"></div>
<div class="innersection"><div class="headerbox"><h3 id="section1.1"><strong>Making The Switch</strong></h3></div>
<p>We do not need to escape this world. We have everything we need here
	to create the next phase of existence. This is the world that, in time,
	becomes the ideal world for each individual. How can each person have 
	their own ideal coexisting with every other person&rsquo;s ideal,
	simultaneously? The answer is voluntary pluralism.</p>
<p>To get a more concise and potent result, we are more concise with our 
	parameters. We are not judging those who do not follow these parameters,
	but we are making a distinction within our own decisions to do business
	with others who are actively creating more freedom for others instead 
	of creating only a space for themselves to temporarily reduce their own
	oppression while doing little to manifest or support protected free markets.</p>
<br><div class="headerbox"><h4 id="section1.2"><em>We believe in real solutions, right now!</em></h4></div>
<p>We do not want to spend our lives working for other people&rsquo;s goals while doing nothing or very little toward what we are in this realm to achieve, which has nothing to do with slaving away for money.</p>
	<p>This is a guide to the establishment of a society that is independent, interconnected, and free from coercion. Today, we have everything we need to circumvent the state entirely. Communities small and large are already flourishing all around the world, and what is lacking in the common lore is a larger and more liberating story we can all manifest into reality.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The next sections will address the following:</p>
	<div class = "callout">
		<div class="callouttext" style="padding: 10px 10px 10px 38px;"><ol>
			<li>People don&rsquo;t see an option</li>
			<li>We are creating an option</li>
			<li>You can create an option</li>
	</ol></div>
	</div>
	<p>Understanding what is possible will lead to a more extensive awareness and empowered utilization of these communities, both with each other and by those still more entrenched in the slave society.</p>
</div>
<div class="outerimage"><img src="img/fourcorners.jpeg"></div>
<br />
<div class="innersection"><div class="headerbox"><h3>What will success look like?</h3></div>
<p><em>The worst evil is people still believing and perpetuating the lie that they have to be controlled by the government. Your way of living should be an act of rebellion that helps make people&rsquo;s choice for freedom a no-brainer.</em></p>
<p>Our idea is strengthened by its many unique attributes. Unlike a proposal that requires massive funding to get off the ground, this idea is aimed at people who are already trying to make a living who hopefully already have resources invested in themselves and could benefit from shifting their business towards a tax-free network that will help them out. The success of this network is not tied to any individual&rsquo;s success. We (Caravanarchy) are simply network support, and others can replace our role should some tragedy befall our specific wing of support. What we are describing is a lifestyle and resource-allocation strategy. The more people get empowered by it, the stronger it gets and the more everyone involved benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Success will be a network that can provide people with what they need to make their lives better. That means alternate income streams, careers, training, and education. A multitude of options when it comes to food, supplies, and services. Alternate healthcare, insurance, and arbitration. Alternate entertainment venues and community spaces.</p>
<p>We are creating this guidebook and an online presence that will do much more to help those specific individuals who want to make a change and commit to these endeavors in a way that makes a difference. Join us in creating a world immune from institutionalized tyranny!</p>

<div class="innersection">
<div class="headerbox"><h2 id="section3"><strong><em>The Purpose of this Guide</em></strong></h2></div>
<p>This is a guide on the scope of what is possible in the next
	1-10 years. This is not a guide on how to create a voluntaryist
	society starting where you are with only the resources present
	in your community. Spreading freedom (and a voluntaryist society)
	requires that you first take care of your personal need for
	autonomy and freedom. It also will eventually require intentional
	choices aimed at starving and bleeding the enemy (the State) 
	while supporting and bolstering your allies and friends in freedom.</p>
<p>The first step is to ascertain whether relocation or nomadic 
	living might be the most lucrative way to achieve your short-term
	goals while transitioning out of the non-agorist system
	 (<a href="1.2_IntroVoluntaryism.html#section3">
	<em>What is Agorism?</em></a>). There will be properties available
	for short or long-term living rent and work-free while you detox
	from society or re-evaluate your goals. These will be voluntary
	properties and will take shape depending on the unanimous consent
	of the people who live there.</p>
	</div>
<div class="innersection">
	<div class="headerbox">
		<h2 id="section4"><strong><em>How to Utilize this Guide</em></strong></h2></div>
<p>They say that a better future starts with an internal change - 
	that you start with yourself to make the world a better place. 
	I don&rsquo;t think one person&rsquo;s actions can be enough to
	create the change needed. Let's all expand our ideas of what's
	possible.</p>
<p>This entire endeavor is focused on real solutions and pulling 
	anarchists out of the current paradigm and placing them in the
	situations they need, regardless of the resources or money they
	have amassed as of yet in the zombie system. It&rsquo;s not too
	hard to opt-out if you have enough support. And this network is
	providing the extra support needed by those who don&rsquo;t 
	already have a network supporting them.</p>
