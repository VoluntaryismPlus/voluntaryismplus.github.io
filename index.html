						<strong>What is the problem?</strong>
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					How did consumers become so separated from
					producers? Why are there less and less good
					options available for food, goods, and other
					services? Why is there not a huge supply of
					untaxed, unregulated grey and black market goods,
					with countless supply lines providing a robust and
					healthy market for those who wish to get their
					needs met through non-government channels? There
					are some places on earth where a direct to
					consumer relationship is still thriving, but we
					are focused on making this available in the vast
					areas that have moved past this practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					The major reason why more farmers don’t work
					outside of the government system is fear. They
					have a healthy fear that they will be found and
					punished if they go against “the law” (aka “the
					lie”). Our mission is to make it possible for
					farmers, agorists, and anyone seeking to free
					themselves from taxes or regulations to sell
					without fear of government persecution.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span
						>There is a common perception that in order to
						be “doing agorism”, one has to be disconnected
						from social media and other forms of
						communication. We recognize the value of privacy
						and support those who wish to remain
						disconnected, but there is also great value in
						having a public-interfacing faction of the
						network aimed at growing and upgrading the
						network of individuals who recognize the true
						nature of the State and of all who seek to
						restrict the freedom to peacefully conduct
						oneself with other consenting individuals, the
						right to freedom of association, the right of
						self-defense, and the right to restitution for
						damages done to the person or property of the
						individual unless the damage was inflicted in
						self-defense.</span
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span
						>There will have to be a group of people who are
						putting themselves on the line in order to grow
						the network. We are not trying to make a network
						that is insular and inaccessible to outsiders.
						We need to create something that is both safe
						and widespread, as the survival of the network
						relies on its dispersed nature, not on one
						branch becoming large and noticeable and thus
						susceptible to being torn down. This benefits
						the market and every individual in it as it is
						imperative to have multiple sources of goods and
						services to create resilient, decentralized, and
						redundant networks.</span

					<h3><strong>What is the solution?</strong></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="img/Agorism.png" />
				</div>
				<p>
					Our current system, heavily reliant on taxes and
					regulations, hinders true freedom and wealth by
					funding undesirable activities and limiting
					individual choice. A key problem is the lack of
					accessible, tax-free goods and services, as
					producers fear leaving the traditional system due
					to uncertain demand. While the demand for such
					"agorist" goods exists, consumers struggle to find
					them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our solution is a decentralized network that uses
					Agorism to foster freedom, wealth, and resilience.
					We're building connections between consumers and
					producers, creating free marketplaces where all
					vocations can thrive outside the conventional
					system. Decentralization ensures there's no single
					point of failure or monopoly, providing countless
					sources of goods and services, increased consumer
					choice, and a robust contingency plan for supply
					lines.

						<em>When All Actions Lead Towards Freedom</em>
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					When you begin to think in terms of the real world
					and what is possible when people are free to act
					as they want, you can begin to see the value that
					would be kept in the family if we made more
					decisions that favored people who knew how to
					direct their actions toward building a strong
					network that will take care of us when we were in
					trouble.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, the network we are working on opposes
					the idea of keeping a job that funds the state
					when there are jobs available to you that
					don&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s why we are working to
					expand the number of jobs available within the
					network that meet these criteria: they do not fund
					the state or people who fund the state.
					Eventually, this will look like all participants
					in all transactions not funding the state with
					their shelter, job, food, or leisure activities.

				</div>
				<p>
					This is a guide outlining the scope of what is
					possible in the next 1-10 years. This is not a
					guide on how to create a voluntaryist society
					starting where you are with only the resources
					present in your local community. That is not
					possible. To achieve this goal, an individual must
					network with people who both share the vision and
					who understand the strategy needed to make the
					vision a reality. No matter how far away these
					pepole are, they are infinitely more useful
					towards the goal of a voluntary society than
					someone who understands the philosophy but has no
					vision.
				</p>
				<p>
					Spreading freedom (and a voluntaryist society)
					requires that you first take care of your personal
					need for autonomy and freedom. It will also
					require intentional choices aimed at both starving
					and bleeding our primary enemy (the State) of
					resources and power while supporting and
					bolstering your allies and friends in freedom.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first step is to ascertain whether relocation
					or nomadic living might be the most lucrative way
					to achieve your short-term goals while
					transitioning out of the non-agorist system (<a
						href="1.2_IntroVoluntaryism.html#section3"
						><em>What is Agorism?</em></a
					>). There are locations available for short or
					long-term living rent and work-free while you
					detox from society or re-evaluate your goals.
					These are voluntary spaces, both nomadic and
					stationary, which take shape depending on the
					unanimous consent of the people who reside there.
				</p>
				<p>
					We seek these spaces out on our journeys, so that
					everywhere we go, we can direct you to them. As
					time progresses, these spaces will transform. For
					example, a property with no development on it can
					be used to sustain people who just need a place to
					stay. If multiple people live there, the cost of
					living can be very small because you only need one
					vehicle to get food and water. Working together,
					we can use free and natural materials to build
					shelters. These properties can produce exports
					that nomadic travelers can sell for them along
					their travels.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you would like to open up a space for this
					purpose, let us know.

					<h3 id="section2.5">
						Beyond "Be the Change": <br />Why Individual
						Transformation Isn't Enough
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					We are often told that in order to create the
					change we want to see in the world, we have to
					start by changing ourselves. The reasoning goes
					that if we start having more positive
					interactions, those around us will also be
					empowered to have positive interactions. I think
					this is a good idea, but that it essentially
					disempowers those who adhere to it. What is
					implied is that the most change we could possibly
					feel accountable for is a very small shift in the
					way certain people think or act due to our
					positive vibes.
				</p>

				<p>
					Most people I meet are already advanced enough
					spiritually and mentally that they know what it is
					to be a good person and can recognize a good
					interaction when they see it. We do not need to
					become spiritual gurus in order for the world to
					be affected by our good actions.
				</p>

				<p>
					With the network (which we are not creating but
					are helping grow) our reasoning is similar but
					differs in a very important way. We believe that
					if you understand the non-agression principle, and
					its implications, including the self-defense
					principle, once introduced to it, you already have
					the necessary development to empower those around
					you.
				</p>

				<p>
					We also believe that the infrastructure is not yet
					in place that would create a simple and effortless
					transition for you and those around you into a
					life adhering to this principle.
				</p>

				<p>
					Therefore, we have created this framework in order
					to inspire you and those you communicate with.
					Hopefully, it will help you understand a new way
					of doing things. This plan will require a fair
					amount of people to change their tune in order to
					actualize the vision, but in reality, many are
					already doing what it takes to make this possible.
				</p>

				<p>
					To say that you alone can make the change needed
					is unrealistic. Perhaps, if you already were
					surrounded by only empowered and flexible
					voluntarists, who were already spending their
					entire lives trying to create an agorist counter
					economy, just being armed with this information
					could be all it took to mobilize yourself and
					those around you to start participating in a
					network that would change your lives and the
					entire world, eventually.
				</p>

				<p>
					However, most people exist within webs with others
					who do not see the same potential outcome of
					freedom for all. People who, usually out of fear,
					are not willing to make a big change to their life
					to help this reality come into existence.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you are in this situation, I do not encourage
					you to try to change the minds of those who do not
					want to hear it. Instead, you should use this
					network to find those who are already on the same
					path that you are.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>Freedom, in This Lifetime</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					You do not need to try to create a new paradigm
					from scratch in your current location or local
					community. To bring about the best of all possible
					worlds, where everyone has access to a free and
					fulfilling way of life, you must find those who
					already agree with your values and vision no
					matter where they might reside. Instead of trying
					to influence a lifestyle change in those still
					resistant to the idea of protected free
					communities, you can combine your efforts with
					those who share your intentions and who already
					see the vision of what is possible in this
					lifetime. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You could spend a lifetime trying to persuade
					others to see the vision themselves and then to
					become active in changing their own lives. But
					there is a quicker way to achieve freedom. Network
					with people who already understand that freedom
					from the existing lies, taxes, and restrictions on
					peaceful activity is needed, and grow resilient
					trade networks with those individuals toward that
					shared goal. This is called agorism, and this
					website is a guide to creating this in your own
					life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though some people have the drive and desire to be
					leaders at the forefront of a dispersed community
					that values and protects their freedom to
					peacefully interact and transact without
					repercussions, we can&rsquo;t wait for those
					people to come out of the woodwork to begin
					creating a new free way of living. Word of mouth
					takes time to propagate. Most people can&rsquo;t
					be expected to change when there isn&rsquo;t an
					obvious and well-worn path towards a new way of
					living.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Creating a new world will require a relatively
					small dispersed group of people who not only are
					interested in a new world but who are prepared to
					take action in their lives to create an alternate
					network of agorists aimed at creating this
					ecosystem for each other, replacing streams of
					resources from the exploitative system with the
					networked goods and services of protected free
					markets. This does not mean an end to the
					importation and production of goods, but simply to
					better sources of them. Sources that do not, for
					example, fund the war machine, enslavement, and
					mass incarceration of human beings.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Until this alternative network becomes more
					ubiquitous, it will be hard for individuals to
					abandon their current lifestyle and transfer all
					their income and expenditures over to these free
					and ethical sources. There are already people
					spread out across the country and world who are
					prepared to make that shift in a way that creates
					more opportunities for everyone seeking a free way
					of life.
				</p>
				<div class="imglt">
					<img src="img/collaboration.jpeg" />
				</div>

				<p>
					The larger community is made up of individuals who
					have the skills and knowledge necessary to support
					one another. What support does the individual need
					from a network? Every good or service you spend
					money on can be re-sourced. Medical care,
					insurance, gasoline, jobs, and education to name a
					few. Everything that drives the world today can be
					provided in a better way by the community.

				<p>
					Some say that a better future starts with an
					internal change - that you must start with
					yourself to make the world a better place. We
					don’t think one person’s actions alone are enough
					to create change at the scale needed to achieve
					our objective. In order to extend your range of
					influence and exercise your power to create
					change, you need to skip trying to change other
					people’s minds and instead connect to others who
					already see the way forward to make a change.
				</p>
				<p>
					Networking with other freedom-seekers and
					expanding your social circles and trade options is
					the most effective way of creating the best of all
					possible worlds. We know this is the way to create
					the best of all possible worlds because it permits
					everyone to choose how to spend their time and
					resources without third parties imposing
					themselves on their free-will choices. You can’t
					change someone’s mind or make them advance
					spiritually or mentally in a way they are not
					ready to. But you can give people a better option
					to spend their hard earned resources and time on.
					This enables them to have more resources to pursue
					what makes them truly happy while also assuring
					themselves a better future.
				</p>
				<p>
					This entire endeavor is focused on real solutions
					and pulling anarchists out of the current paradigm
					and placing them in the situations they need,
					regardless of the resources or money they have
					amassed as of yet in the zombie system. It’s not
					too hard to opt-out if you have enough support.
					This network is providing the extra support needed
					by those who don’t already have a group of
					individuals bolstering their efforts to bring
					about a free and thriving existence for themselves
					and others.
