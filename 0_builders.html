					<h2>Build Your Business. Without Permission.</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					You create value. You solve problems. You have skills people need. But the system 
					wants its cut—through taxes, licenses, fees, regulations, and platform commissions. 
					They want to control who can work, where, when, and how much they can charge.
				</p>
				<p>
					What if you could just... trade? Directly with people who value your work. No 
					middleman. No government approval. No corporate overlords taking 20-30% off the top. 
					Just free people exchanging value voluntarily.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>That's what we're building. And it's working.</strong>

					<h3>Is This Legal?</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>Short answer: Trading goods and services for cash, crypto, or barter is legal.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The legal gray area is around taxes and licensing. We encourage you to:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Understand your local laws and make informed choices</li>
						<li>Recognize that many regulations exist to extract money, not protect people</li>
						<li>Decide for yourself what level of risk you're comfortable with</li>
						<li>Know that millions operate in cash/informal economies worldwide</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<em>We're not lawyers and this isn't legal advice. We're people choosing to trade freely and accepting the responsibility that comes with that choice.</em>

			<!-- CHALLENGES & REALITY CHECKS -->
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>It's Not All Success Stories: What Can Go Wrong</h2>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					Honesty matters. Here are real challenges network members have faced, what went wrong, and what they learned.
				</p>
				
				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Challenge #1: "I Quit Too Soon Without Testing"</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>"I was so excited about freedom that I quit my job after one good festival. Had $5k saved, figured I'd make it work. Reality hit hard."</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						What happened: Festival season ended. Winter came. Income dropped to nearly zero for 3 months. Burned through savings in 6 weeks. Had to take a worse job than the one I quit, set me back a year.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The lesson:</strong> One good month doesn't prove sustainability. Test your income for at least 6 months before quitting. Have a full year of expenses saved if you're seasonal.
					</p>
					<p><em>— Jake, 29, Former Craft Vendor (now back on track with better planning)</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Challenge #2: "My Product Wasn't Actually That Good"</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>"I thought my jewelry was amazing. Family loved it. Friends said it was great. But it didn't sell at festivals."</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						What happened: Made 200 pieces. Invested $2,000 in materials and booth fees. Sold maybe 15 pieces total across 3 festivals. Lost money, felt like a failure.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The lesson:</strong> Friends/family aren't honest critics. Test with small batches first. Get brutal feedback from people who'll actually buy. Pivot based on what sells, not what you think should sell.
					</p>
					<p><em>— Maria, 34 (switched to different style, now profitable)</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Challenge #3: "I Couldn't Handle the Uncertainty"</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>"The money was actually decent, but the inconsistency killed me. One month $3k, next month $800. I couldn't sleep."</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						What happened: Mental health suffered. Constant anxiety about money. Couldn't plan anything. Ended up going back to W-2 job for stability.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The lesson:</strong> Agorist income is variable. If you need predictability for your mental health, either build multiple stable streams first, or this path might not be for you. That's okay—know yourself.
					</p>
					<p><em>— David, 41 (found hybrid approach: part-time W-2 + agorist side income works better)</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Challenge #4: "I Underestimated How Hard Solo Business Is"</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>"I'm great at my craft, terrible at marketing, bookkeeping, customer service. Turns out running a business is 20% craft, 80% everything else."</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						What happened: Skills were solid, but couldn't get customers. Forgot to track expenses. Double-booked myself. Showed up late. Slowly lost credibility.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The lesson:</strong> Being good at your skill ≠ being good at business. Either learn the business side or partner with someone who has those skills. Or join a caravan/collective where others handle what you're weak at.
					</p>
					<p><em>— Tom, 38 (joined caravan, now focuses on craft while others handle logistics)</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Challenge #5: "Festival Culture Wasn't For Me"</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>"I'm an introvert. Three days of constant customer interaction at festivals left me completely drained. Made money but hated every minute."</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						What happened: Realized I'd built income around something I dreaded. Stopped doing festivals. Income dropped. Had to rebuild with different approach.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The lesson:</strong> Build income around what you can actually sustain long-term. If you hate festivals, focus on online sales, wholesale, or bounty board instead. Money isn't worth misery.
					</p>
					<p><em>— Lisa, 32 (now does wholesale + custom orders, much happier)</em></p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<!-- WHAT ACTUALLY DETERMINES SUCCESS -->
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>What Actually Determines Success vs Failure</h2>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					After watching hundreds of people try agorist business, here are the patterns that separate those who make it from those who don't:
				</p>
				
				<div class="overview-flex">
					<div class="overview-text">
						<h3>What Successful People Do:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>✅ <strong>Test before committing:</strong> Validate income for 6+ months first</li>
							<li>✅ <strong>Diversify income:</strong> Multiple streams, never rely on one thing</li>
							<li>✅ <strong>Build runway:</strong> 6-12 months saved before transition</li>
							<li>✅ <strong>Get honest feedback:</strong> From real customers, not friends</li>
							<li>✅ <strong>Stay connected:</strong> Active in network, ask for help</li>
							<li>✅ <strong>Adapt quickly:</strong> Pivot when something isn't working</li>
							<li>✅ <strong>Manage expectations:</strong> Know it takes 12-18 months to stabilize</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="overview-text">
						<h3>What Causes Failures:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>❌ <strong>Impulsive quitting:</strong> No testing, no runway, "I'll figure it out"</li>
							<li>❌ <strong>Single income source:</strong> All eggs in one basket</li>
							<li>❌ <strong>Ignoring feedback:</strong> Making what they want, not what sells</li>
							<li>❌ <strong>Going solo:</strong> No network support, trying to do everything alone</li>
							<li>❌ <strong>Unrealistic timeline:</strong> Expect instant success, quit when it's hard</li>
							<li>❌ <strong>Wrong fit:</strong> Building income around things they hate</li>
							<li>❌ <strong>No financial buffer:</strong> First setback destroys them</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="callout">
					<h3>The Uncomfortable Truth</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>About 60% of people who try agorist business full-time succeed long-term.</strong> That means 40% go back to traditional employment or find hybrid approaches.
					</p>
					<p>
						This isn't failure—it's finding what works for you. Some people discover they need more structure, more stability, or different types of work than pure agorist business provides. That's valuable self-knowledge.
					</p>
					<p>
						The ones who succeed aren't necessarily more talented or harder working. They're the ones who:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Test thoroughly before committing</li>
						<li>Build proper financial runway</li>
						<li>Stay connected to the network</li>
						<li>Adapt when plans don't work</li>
						<li>Know themselves well enough to build sustainable income</li>
