						When many speak of a hate for

					"I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or
					fable about modern capitalist society..." - Hwang
					Dong-hyuk, Director of 'Squid Games'
				</p>
				<p>
					I think many, likely including the author of Squid
					Games, have thrust themselves into the middle of a
					war against their current social structure, but
					their attention and efforts are being directed
					against a social structure that doesn't exist.
					Thus, the social structure(s) *actually*
					oppressing us not only remain in tact, but GROW!
				</p>
				<p>
					That's one thing that happens when people use
					words like "Capitalism" to refer to modern
					societies today that lack one or more of the
					fundamental prerequisites of Capitalism.
				</p>
				<h4><em>Propertarianism:</em></h4>
				<p>
					<em
						>A good way to divide capitalist Voluntaryists
						from socialist Voluntaryists is where they draw
						the line with private property. Voluntaryists
						consider private property to be a valid form of
						ownership.</em

				<h3><em>Anarchy Verbiage</em></h3>
				<h4><em>Agorism</em></h4>
				<p>
					<em
						>A social philosophy that advocates creating a
						society in which all relations between people
						are voluntary exchanges by means of
						counter-economics, engaging with aspects of
						nonviolent revolution. Agorists believe that
						counter-economics (using black and gray markets,
						i.e. the underground untaxed economy) is the
						path to a free society.</em

				<h4><em>Non-Aggression Principle</em></h4>
				<p>
					<em
						>The NAP is a concept in which aggression,
						defined as initiating or threatening any
						forceful interference with either an individual
						or their property is inherently wrong.</em
					>
				</p>
				<h4><em>Exit and Build</em></h4>
				<p>
					<em
						>To escape the control of the ruling class and
						build our own resilient communities and networks
						that can contribute towards more and more of the
						population&rsquo;s life and prosperity through
						voluntaryist exchange.</em
					>
				</p>
				<h4><em>Taxation</em></h4>
				<p>
					<em
						>Theft by extortion. Nobody knows better than
						you how best to spend your money and even if
						they did, nobody has a higher claim over your
						property, wealth, etc, than you do. It is only
						the owner of a thing that has the right to
						dictate the terms of use of that thing.</em

				</p>
				<h4><em>Voting</em></h4>
				<p>
					<em
						>Manufacturing Consent where it doesn&rsquo;t
						exist. Voting, if it worked, would be forcing
						your opinion down another person&rsquo;s
						throat.</em
					>
				</p>
				<h4><em>Government Workers</em></h4>
				<p>
					<em
						>They are net-extortion (&ldquo;tax&rdquo;)
						consumers, so they don&rsquo;t pay taxes, they
						just receive less tax revenue. If there
						weren&rsquo;t government workers, there would be
						private industry workers who would consist of
						many of the same people who are tax-funded
						today.</em

					<em>Capitalism: what can we agree on?</em>
				</h3>
				<h4><em>Defining Capitalism:</em></h4>
				<p>
					<em
						>Capitalism is a free-market economic system
						defined by the absence of the State in trade and
						industry, where businesses are privately owned
						and operated for profit.
					</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em
						>We do not define Capitalism as a political
						system like most other definitions to eliminate
						the self-contradiction between a system absent
						State regulation, taxation, or interference
						while miraculously also involving politics
						(lol).</em
					>
				</p>
				<h4><em>Profit and Barter</em></h4>
				<p>
					<em
						>&nbsp;Also, profit in this definition does not
						mean only or even necessarily have to do with
						money. If I traded an apple for a banana, I
						profited by one banana which I valued more than
						I valued the apple I traded for it, just as my
						trade partner profited by one apple in this same
						way or we wouldn&rsquo;t have traded in the
						first place.</em
					>
				</p>
				<h4>
					<em>Other Definitions of Capitalism</em>
				</h4>
				<p>
					<em
						>There is a strong preference in some circles
						for describing capitalism as the cause of our
						current threats to humanity and the environment.
						As well as past atrocities against ethnic groups
						and individuals at large. This attribution is
						undeserved, however. The real issue causing such
						horrendous occurances is the current system,
						which inflates a fake dollar and kills under the
						guise of &ldquo;government&rdquo;.</em
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em
						>Another misapplied explanation that capitalism
						means the love of money and the search for it at
						the expense of others. Nothing in capitalism
						excludes the ability for someone to seek damages
						against a violation of consent.&nbsp;</em
