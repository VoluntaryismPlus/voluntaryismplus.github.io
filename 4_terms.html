      <h1>Definition of Terms</h1>

      <div class="innersection">      <h3>A New Lexicon for a Free Society</h3>
        <p>
          <em>A new language, de-colonized.</em> We need easily referenced, better versions of things and ways to say them. We have a lot to leave behind. There are certain aspects of the current paradigm that have been holding us back. The effort to adopt a new paradigm can be aided by the addition of a new language and concepts to fill in the gaps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clear communication requires shared definitions. This page provides precise definitions for key terms used throughout the Network and the broader voluntaryist movement. Whether you're new to these concepts or just need a quick reference, this glossary ensures we're all speaking the same language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Terms are organized by category for easy reference. For deeper exploration of any concept, follow the links to relevant pages in The Library or Workshop.

        <h2>Core Philosophy</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Anarchy / Anarchism</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>An-</strong> (without) + <strong>-archy</strong> (rulers). A social system based on voluntary cooperation without institutionalized authority or coercive government. Not chaos or disorder, but rather self-organization without imposed hierarchy. See <a href="4_IntroVoluntaryism.html">Intro to Voluntaryism</a> for detailed explanation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Voluntaryism</h4>
          <p>
            The moral philosophy that all human interaction should be voluntary and consensual. Voluntaryism rejects the initiation of force in all forms including violence, theft, fraud, and coercion. It permits defensive force only. Voluntaryism holds that no person or group has legitimate authority over another. See <a href="4_IntroVoluntaryism.html">Intro to Voluntaryism</a>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Agorism</h4>
          <p>
            A social philosophy that advocates creating a society in which all relations between people are voluntary exchanges by means of counter-economics, engaging with aspects of nonviolent revolution. Agorists believe that counter-economics (using black and gray markets, i.e. the underground untaxed economy) is the path to a free society. Coined by Samuel Edward Konkin III. The term comes from "agora," the ancient Greek marketplace. See <a href="4_WhyAgorismWorks.html">Why Agorism Works</a>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Counter-Economics</h4>
          <p>
            All peaceful human action that the state has forbidden, regulated, or taxed. This includes black markets (illegal), grey markets (unregulated), and any economic activity conducted outside state supervision. Counter-economics is the practice of agorism—building the parallel economy.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>The State</h4>
          <p>
            An institution claiming a territorial monopoly on the legitimate use of force. The state extracts resources through taxation (coercive funding) and enforces compliance through threat of imprisonment or violence. Voluntaryists reject the state's claimed legitimacy while acknowledging its factual power.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Authority</h4>
          <p>
            The supposed right to rule over others. Voluntaryists distinguish between <em>de facto</em> power (ability to force compliance) and <em>de jure</em> authority (legitimate right to rule). We acknowledge states have power but deny they have legitimate authority. No person or group possesses moral authority over peaceful individuals.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Politics</h4>
          <p>
            Politics is not anarchy. We do not consider ourselves to be "talking politics." Politics implies participation in state systems of control and coercion. We're building alternatives, not seeking political solutions.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h2>Ethical Principles</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Non-Aggression Principle (NAP)</h4>
          <p>
            The NAP is a concept in which aggression, defined as initiating or threatening any forceful interference with either an individual or their property, is inherently wrong. The NAP permits defensive force but prohibits aggressive force. This is the foundational ethical principle of voluntaryism. Note: The NAP doesn't prohibit all force—only the <em>initiation</em> of force.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Self-Defense Principle (SDP)</h4>
          <p>
            The principle that individuals have the right to defend themselves, their property, and others against aggression using proportional force. Self-defense is not aggression—it's a response to aggression. The SDP justifies resistance to state coercion. <em>"I'm a voluntaryist. But I reserve the right to self-defense—and I will take away your 'free will' choice to do something that harms another person."</em>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Principle of Restitution (PoR)</h4>
          <p>
            Restitution, not punishment. Punishment doesn't bring any justice. The principle that justice requires making victims whole rather than punishing aggressors. When someone is harmed, the aggressor should provide restitution (compensation) to the victim. This contrasts with state "justice" which punishes but rarely compensates victims. The state extorts—they don't restore. It is one huge lie after another.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Self-Ownership</h4>
          <p>
            The foundational principle that each person owns themselves—their body, their mind, their labor. No one else has a higher claim to your life or the fruits of your labor. Self-ownership is the basis for all property rights and voluntary interaction.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Property Rights</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>What is property?</strong> The right to exclude others from the use of a thing. <strong>What is the purpose of property?</strong> To reduce conflict over scarce resources. In voluntaryist philosophy, legitimate property is acquired through homesteading (first use), voluntary exchange, or gift. Property obtained through aggression (theft, state expropriation) is illegitimate.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Consent</h4>
          <p>
            What is consent? What conditions must ALL be met for consent to exist?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Consent must be revokable at any time</li>
            <li>Consent must be voluntary and given of free will, NOT under duress</li>
            <li>Consent must be informed. One can consent to something with the knowledge that they don't know everything they're getting into.</li>
            <li>Explicit dissent > implicit consent</li>
            <li>Fraudulent basis negates consent</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Rights</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>What are Rights?</strong> Rights are moral principles defining proper human conduct. Key questions: Do you have the right to delegate a right to someone that you don't have yourself? What gives someone a right? If you do not have the right to do an action yourself, what gives you the right to elect someone to do it on your behalf? Voluntaryists hold that no one can delegate rights they don't possess—thus no one can delegate authority to the state that individuals don't have.

        <h2>Economic Systems & Terms</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Capitalism</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Defining Capitalism:</strong> Capitalism is a free-market economic system defined by the absence of the State in trade and industry, where businesses are privately owned and operated for profit. We do not define Capitalism as a political system like most other definitions to eliminate the self-contradiction between a system absent State regulation, taxation, or interference while miraculously also involving politics.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Mislabeling Problem:</strong> There is a word for the current system we have in many places in the world: <em>Crony capitalism</em>. When many speak of a hate for "capitalism" they are often referring to consumerism, the love of money, or any other aspect of the current system. To call it capitalism is to mislabel the cause for contempt. That's one thing that happens when people use words like "Capitalism" to refer to modern societies today that lack one or more of the fundamental prerequisites of Capitalism.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Real Issue:</strong> There is a strong preference in some circles for describing capitalism as the cause of our current threats to humanity and the environment, as well as past atrocities against ethnic groups and individuals at large. This attribution is undeserved, however. The real issue causing such horrendous occurrences is the current system, which inflates a fake dollar and kills under the guise of "government."
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Profit and Barter</h4>
          <p>
            Profit in our definition does not mean only or even necessarily have to do with money. If I traded an apple for a banana, I profited by one banana which I valued more than I valued the apple I traded for it, just as my trade partner profited by one apple in this same way or we wouldn't have traded in the first place. Profit is subjective value gain—both parties profit in every voluntary exchange or it wouldn't occur.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Free Market</h4>
          <p>
            A system of voluntary exchange free from state intervention. In a free market, prices are determined by supply and demand, contracts are enforced through reputation and arbitration, and no one has monopoly power backed by violence. Free markets produce prosperity through competition and innovation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Black Market / Grey Market</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Black Market:</strong> Economic activity the state has explicitly criminalized—drugs, weapons, unlicensed services.<br>
            <strong>Grey Market:</strong> Economic activity that operates outside state regulation without being explicitly illegal—cash transactions, barter, crypto, informal economy. Both are forms of counter-economics and crucial to building parallel institutions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Parallel Economy</h4>
          <p>
            A complete economic ecosystem operating outside state control—production, distribution, trade, and consumption all conducted through counter-economic means. The parallel economy is what agorists build as we withdraw support from the state economy.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Taxation</h4>
          <p>
            Theft by extortion. Nobody knows better than you how best to spend your money and even if they did, nobody has a higher claim over your property, wealth, etc., than you do. It is only the owner of a thing that has the right to dictate the terms of use of that thing. The state extracts wealth through threat of imprisonment or violence—textbook extortion.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Mutual Aid</h4>
          <p>
            Voluntary cooperation for mutual benefit. Mutual aid networks provide support during hardship—food, shelter, medical care, security—without state welfare systems. Mutual aid is proof that people don't need government to care for each other.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h2>Legal & Social Systems</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Voluntary Pluralism</h4>
          <p>
            The principle that multiple legal and social systems can coexist peacefully when participation is voluntary. You choose which community to join, which rules to follow, and which legal system governs your disputes—and you can exit if you disagree. Competition among systems drives improvement.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Polycentric Law</h4>
          <p>
            A legal system with multiple competing sources of law rather than a single monopoly. Individuals choose which law merchant, arbitration service, or legal code governs their transactions. Polycentric law emerged naturally in medieval Iceland, medieval Ireland (Brehon Law), and merchant communities throughout history.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Customary Law</h4>
          <p>
            Law that emerges from repeated practice and mutual agreement rather than being imposed by legislators. Customary law evolves through social interaction, tested by time and adapted to local conditions. It's law discovered through practice, not invented by rulers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Free Association</h4>
          <p>
            The right to choose with whom you interact, trade, and form communities. Free association means no forced integration, no compelled service, and no obligation to associate with those you reject. The flip side is free disassociation—the right to exclude and be excluded.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Consensus</h4>
          <p>
            Decision-making where all parties agree before action is taken. Consensus doesn't require unanimity on every detail, but it does require that no one has objections significant enough to block action. Different from majority rule, which forces minority compliance. The Network favors consensus-based governance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Militia</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>What is a militia?</strong> It is the whole people. It is the body of the people. <em>"For a people who are free and who mean to remain so, a well-organized and armed militia is their best security."</em> - Thomas Jefferson
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"Once a standing army is established in any country, the people lose their liberty."</em> - George Mason
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"What is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty."</em> - Elbridge Gerry, 5th VP of US
          </p>
          <p>
            Militia is a <strong>DISTRIBUTED</strong> force, which is a force that cannot be conquered. A polite society is an armed society. See <a href="4_defense.html">Collective Defense</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h2>State Systems & Alternatives</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Voting</h4>
          <p>
            Manufacturing consent where it doesn't exist. Voting, if it worked, would be forcing your opinion down another person's throat. Voluntaryists reject voting in state elections as legitimizing coercion—you can't vote away others' rights even if you have the majority.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Government Workers</h4>
          <p>
            They are net-extortion ("tax") consumers, so they don't pay taxes, they just receive less tax revenue. If there weren't government workers, there would be private industry workers who would consist of many of the same people who are tax-funded today. Government employment is parasitic—it produces no net value, only redistribution of extracted wealth.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>State of Coercion / Involuntaryism</h4>
          <p>
            If you are not a voluntaryist, you're an involuntaryist. You believe that there should be some actions that should NOT be voluntary and consensual and that some people should have rights that others don't. This is the state of coercion—accepting that some have legitimate authority to force others.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Minarchy</h4>
          <p>
            <em>"An anarchist who hasn't yet run out of excuses."</em> Minarchism is the belief in minimal government—usually limited to courts, police, and military. Voluntaryists reject even minimal states as illegitimate. Any government funding requires taxation (theft), and any government enforcement requires aggression against peaceful people. You can't have a "little bit" of coercion.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Georgism</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Minarchy Type:</strong> Georgists believe land is a scarce resource and is the only thing that should be taxed. They propose a switching over of all lands to be reappropriated in this new way as each landowner passes away. Voluntaryists reject this as still being theft—taxing land means you don't truly own it, the state does.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Propertarianism</h4>
          <p>
            A good way to divide capitalist voluntaryists from socialist voluntaryists is where they draw the line with private property. Voluntaryists (propertarians) consider private property to be a valid form of ownership. We believe individuals can legitimately own land, buildings, means of production through homesteading or voluntary exchange.

        <h2>Network-Specific Terms</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>The Network</h4>
          <p>
            Our decentralized community of voluntaryists building parallel institutions. The Network includes hosts, guilds, markets, and communication channels—all operating on NAP principles without central leadership. See <a href="2_structure.html">Network Structure</a>.

          <h4>Bounty Board</h4>
          <p>
            A marketplace for posting needs and offerings—where members request services, offer goods, or post opportunities. The Bounty Board facilitates counter-economic exchange. See <a href="7_bountyboard.html">Bounty Board</a>.

        <h2>Strategy & Tactics</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Exit and Build</h4>
          <p>
            To escape the control of the ruling class and build our own resilient communities and networks that can contribute towards more and more of the population's life and prosperity through voluntaryist exchange. Don't waste energy trying to reform the system—exit it and build better alternatives.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Voluntaryism Plus</h4>
          <p>
            The Network's enhanced approach to voluntaryism—not just believing in voluntary interaction but actively building infrastructure for others to live freely. Voluntaryism Plus emphasizes intention: does your plan create freedom only for yourself, or does it enable freedom for others? See <a href="4_VoluntaryismPlus.html">Voluntaryism Plus</a>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Directionality</h4>
          <p>
            A philosophy of action-oriented decision-making. Rather than seeking absolute truth or perfect knowledge, directionality asks: "Does the answer to this question change how I'll act?" Focus on conclusions that lead to meaningful action toward your goals. See <a href="4_directionality.html">Directionality</a>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Abundance Loops</h4>
          <p>
            Economic and social patterns where prosperity generates more prosperity through voluntary exchange. Creating abundance loops means designing your activities so success benefits both you and others in the Network, creating positive feedback that grows wealth collectively. See <a href="4_WhyAgorismWorks.html">Why Agorism Works</a>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Keeping It in the Family</h4>
          <p>
            The strategy of directing resources to Network members rather than allowing wealth to bleed back into state systems. When you trade with fellow agorists, wealth stays in the parallel economy and funds freedom rather than tyranny. Prioritize doing business with those actively building voluntary alternatives.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Security Mesh</h4>
          <p>
            Decentralized, community-based security achieved through multiple overlapping protection methods rather than a single police force. The security mesh includes private protection services, neighborhood watch, armed self-defense, and social pressure. No single point of failure. See <a href="4_security.html">Security Mesh</a>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Economic Secession</h4>
          <p>
            Withdrawing participation from state-controlled markets and systems. Economic secession means earning, spending, and saving outside state surveillance and taxation—using cash, cryptocurrency, barter, and grey market services. The core practice of counter-economics.

        <h2>Common Misunderstandings</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>"Anarchy is chaos"</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>False.</strong> Anarchy is order without imposed authority. Chaos is <em>dis</em>order—breakdown of social organization. Anarchist societies throughout history have been highly ordered through customary law, voluntary cooperation, and mutual aid. What we call "chaos" is often the violent transition between state systems. See <a href="4_examples.html">Anarchy Examples</a>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>"Voluntaryism means no rules"</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>False.</strong> Voluntaryism means no <em>rulers</em>, not no rules. Voluntary communities can have extensive rules—but all members consent to those rules by choosing to join. The difference is choice: you can leave and join a community with different rules. No one forces you to participate in arrangements you reject.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>"The NAP prohibits all force"</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>False.</strong> The NAP prohibits the <em>initiation</em> of force, not defensive force. Self-defense, defense of others, and enforcement of contracts through agreed arbitration are all consistent with the NAP. What's prohibited is aggressive force—attacking people or property that haven't aggressed against you.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>"Agorism requires hiding from authorities"</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Partially false.</strong> While some counter-economic activity must be discreet (black markets), much of it can operate openly in grey markets. Agorism isn't primarily about hiding—it's about building visible alternatives that make the state irrelevant. Many agorist businesses operate publicly while minimizing state involvement.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>"This only works for individuals, not communities"</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>False.</strong> Historical examples prove voluntary organization scales to large communities. Medieval Iceland's Commonwealth lasted over 300 years with 50,000+ people. The challenge isn't scale—it's maintaining voluntary principles as communities grow. See <a href="4_examples.html">Anarchy Examples</a> and <a href="4_downfall.html">Downfall of the Greats</a>.

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            <strong>What has voluntaryism looked like in action?</strong> The moral philosophy of voluntaryism does not need to posit a working solution for how the world would look without a government. But there are many resources on times past and present where voluntaryism has existed or exists. See <a href="4_examples.html">Anarchy Examples</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Our idea of the next world:</strong> A nonfiction world where humans have the powers they are born with—self-ownership, empathy, health, critical thinking, etc.
