			<h1>Socially Perpetuated Self-Encagement</h1>

				<h2>What To Leave Behind</h2>
				<p>
					True clarity begins when we shed the
					illusions that bind us. It's not about
					passing judgment on others, but about
					knowing the fundamental truths that
					define our interactions. When confronted
					with our core ideas, especially
					Voluntaryism, we must discern: does
					their disagreement stem from a nuanced
					philosophical difference, or from an
					endorsement of aggression against
					peaceful people?
				</p>
				<p>
					This discernment is not about exclusion,
					but about establishing clear boundaries
					for our own security and the integrity
					of the Network. Where do individuals
					draw the line on initiating or
					supporting force against free people and
					their property? Their answer defines
					whether they are a boon to our
					collective freedom or a potential threat
					to the very foundations we are building.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Stop Playing?</h2>
				<p>
					Life itself is a profound game, and the
					critical move is to seize ownership of
					your strategy and command your
					decisions. For too long, many have
					chosen to live within a fabricated
					nightmare, finding escapism in trivial
					diversions rather than recognizing the
					epic adventure that their own existence
					truly is. This is not about abandoning
					fun, but about prioritizing genuine
					liberty.
				</p>
				<p>
					The time has come to transform your life
					into the ultimate adventure—a thrilling
					pursuit of self-sovereignty and
					collaborative creation. Once your own
					life is the primary, compelling game,
					then the smaller "games of men" can be
					engaged with on your own terms, if
					desired, rather than being passively
					endured as a distraction from true
					living.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>
					What Has Failed In Our Own Movement?
				</h2>
				<p>
					The world overflows with individuals
					yearning for freedom, yet our collective
					progress is often hampered by a lack of
					overt, actionable support. Too many of
					us, perhaps well-intentioned, rely on
					subtle messages and abstract metaphors,
					expecting others to "get it" through
					indirect cues. This approach, however,
					often misdirects vital energy and
					attention away from the tangible actions
					that could truly bring about change.
				</p>
				<p>
					A genuinely revolutionary movement
					cannot be built on unspoken
					understandings or academic theories
					alone. Pragmatism dictates that if a
					better way exists—a path that reduces
					suffering and maximizes liberty—it is
					our absolute duty to pursue it with
					relentless focus. True freedom demands
					direct, actionable content, not just
					intellectual contemplation.
				</p>
				<h3>Common Failings:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong
							>Vision Not Large
							Enough:</strong
						>
						Limiting potential, failing to
						imagine the truly free world we can
						create.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong
							>Scared by
							Probabilities:</strong
						>
						Allowing statistical fears to
						paralyze action rather than
						embracing bold experimentation.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong
							>Failing to Seize the
							Advantage:</strong
						>
						Missing critical opportunities to
						advance freedom when conditions are
						favorable.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong
							>Self-Perpetuated
							Stagnation:</strong
						>
						Getting stuck in analysis paralysis
						or comfortable routines, preventing
						necessary evolution.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Waiting to Do Something</h2>
				<p>
					The illusion of waiting for the "perfect
					moment" or the "right conditions" is one
					of the most insidious forms of
					self-encagement. Every delayed action
					is, in itself, a choice with profound
					consequences, actively postponing the
					liberation you desire. The future we
					envision is not a destination we arrive
					at by default, but a reality we
					construct through immediate, decisive
					steps.
				</p>
				<p>
					Urgency is not a burden; it is a
					catalyst for change. The world does not
					pause for our hesitations; it is shaped
					by those who dare to act in the present.
					Your contributions, however small they
					may seem, become significant ripples in
					the current of progress when you choose
					to cease waiting and start building.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Relying on the Next Generation</h2>
				<p>
					It is a comforting, yet dangerous,
					delusion to believe that the monumental
					task of securing freedom rests solely on
					the shoulders of those who come after
					us. This passive deferral of
					responsibility is a betrayal of the
					present, allowing oppressive systems to
					strengthen while we hope for a future
					generation to miraculously dismantle
					them. Freedom is not an inheritance to
					be passively received; it is a legacy
					that must be actively fought for and
					built by each generation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The foundation for a truly free future
					must be laid by adults in the present.
					Our actions, our courage, and our
					willingness to step into the arena today
					are what will empower, rather than
					burden, those who follow. The greatest
					gift we can give the next generation is
					not just the idea of freedom, but a
					living, breathing, flourishing example
					of it, built through our direct
					engagement now.

				<h2>
					Even More Ways the State Brings Us Down
				</h2>
				<p>
					The coercive reach of the state extends
					far beyond overt displays of power,
					subtly infiltrating and draining our
					potential through mechanisms that appear
					benign or even necessary. These
					insidious impositions do more than just
					lighten our pockets; they actively
					suppress our natural inclination towards
					self-governance, innovation, and
					voluntary collaboration.
				</p>
				<h3>Taxes</h3>
				<p>
					Taxes are not simply a civic duty; they
					are a fundamental extraction of your
					creative life force and accumulated
					wealth, seized without your explicit
					consent. This forced contribution
					diverts your hard-earned resources from
					projects you choose, businesses you
					support, and communities you wish to
					build, instead funneling them into a
					system that often perpetuates the very
					tyranny you seek to escape. Every dollar
					involuntarily taken empowers the
					leviathan you wish to shrink.
				</p>
				<h3>Regulations</h3>
				<p>
					State regulations, often touted as
					safeguards, are in practice a
					monopolization of control over human
					conduct and enterprise. They stifle
					organic innovation, erect arbitrary
					barriers to entry, and suppress the
					natural emergence of efficient,
					self-governing solutions. Instead of
					protecting, they often consolidate
					power, protect established interests,
					and prevent individuals from creatively
					adapting to real-world challenges.
				</p>
				<p>
					A truly free society thrives on the
					dynamic power of voluntary standards,
					reputation-based trust, and mutually
					agreed-upon best practices. These
					decentralized, bottom-up forms of
					regulation are inherently more agile,
					adaptive, and effective than rigid,
					top-down mandates imposed by a single,
					coercive authority. The market itself is
					the most efficient regulator when left
					unmolested by a monopoly on force.
				</p>
				<h3>Licensing & Permission Systems</h3>
				<p>
					Beyond taxes and regulations, state
					licensing and permission systems create
					artificial gatekeepers to human
					potential. These bureaucratic hurdles
					demand compliance and payment, often
					without genuinely ensuring competence,
					thereby restricting individuals from
					freely pursuing their passions, offering
					their skills, or starting ventures
					without explicit governmental approval.
				</p>
				<p>
					These systems do not primarily protect
					the public; they serve to centralize
					control, limit competition, and
					establish privileged monopolies. True
					competence and trust in a free society
					emerge organically from reputation,
					demonstrable skill, and consistent,
					voluntary delivery of value—not from a
					piece of paper issued by an
					unaccountable bureaucracy.

				<h2>
					Questions Oft Mishandled By Anarchists:
				</h2>
				<p>
					Our movement must confront its most
					challenging questions with unwavering
					clarity and actionable answers. Too
					often, critical inquiries are met with
					evasion or overly theoretical responses,
					hindering the very progress we seek.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are the top three questions that
					demand our direct and effective
					responses:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ol>
						<li>
							Is there a plausible strategy to
							achieve freedom in this
							lifetime?
						</li>
						<li>
							Is it possible to end the state
							in this lifetime?
						</li>
						<li>
							Can we build a network that will
							bring it down?
						</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<h3>Our answers: Yes!</h3>
