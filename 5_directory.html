			<h1>Network Directory</h1>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Find Your Tribe</h2>
				<p>
					The Network Directory is how you find people, resources, opportunities, and connections across our distributed community. Unlike a phonebook, this is a living map of who's doing what, where they are, what they need, and what they offer. The Directory grows as the network grows—organic, decentralized, and constantly evolving.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whether you're looking for someone with a specific skill, seeking collaborators for a project, trying to find network members in your area, or offering your own services and resources—the Directory is your starting point.

				<h2>How The Directory Works</h2>
				<p>
					The Network Directory operates on multiple levels of access, balancing openness with privacy and security:
				</p>

				<h3>Public Directory: Open to All</h3>
				<p>
					The public directory includes individuals who are open to general contact and collaboration from anyone interested in the network. This is the entry point for newcomers and the broadest level of connection.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Who's in the public directory:</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Network members who welcome contact from new people</li>
					<li>Businesses and services advertising their offerings</li>
					<li>Event organizers and community builders</li>
					<li>Educators and content creators</li>
					<li>Anyone choosing to make their presence known publicly</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>What information is shared:</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Name (real or pseudonym, member's choice)</li>
					<li>General location (city/region, not specific address)</li>
					<li>Skills, interests, or offerings</li>
					<li>Contact method (email, secure messaging, etc.)</li>
					<li>Brief bio or description of what they're building</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>How to add yourself:</strong> Submit your information through the network contact form or email us at <a href="mailto:caravanarchy@proton.me">caravanarchy@proton.me</a>. You control what information you share and can update or remove your listing at any time.
				</p>

				<h3>Private Directory: Vetted Members Only</h3>
				<p>
					The private directory lists trusted individuals available for deeper, more private engagement. Access requires prior vetting through our <a href="4_admissions.html">Admissions Portal</a>, ensuring secure and reliable connections within our core network.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Why the private directory exists:</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Some opportunities require trust that can't be established instantly</li>
					<li>Certain resources (property locations, safe houses, storage) need operational security</li>
					<li>Network members facing state harassment need protected communication channels</li>
					<li>High-value collaborations require demonstrated reliability</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>What's different in the private directory:</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>More detailed location information (for hosting, meetups, etc.)</li>
					<li>Direct contact information for faster communication</li>
					<li>Access to specialized services or resources</li>
					<li>Information about vetting level and reputation within the network</li>
					<li>Connections to specific guilds, projects, or initiatives</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>How to access:</strong> Complete the vetting process through the Admissions Portal. This typically involves demonstrating alignment with network values, establishing trust through participation, and references from existing vetted members.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>How to initiate contact with vetted members:</strong> Email us at <a href="mailto:caravanarchy@proton.me">caravanarchy@proton.me</a> with your request. We facilitate introductions while protecting member privacy.
				</p>

				<h3>Guild & Project Directories</h3>
				<p>
					Beyond general directories, specialized directories exist for <a href="4_guilds.html">guilds</a>, projects, and initiatives. These are organized around shared focus rather than geography:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Guild Directories:</strong> Find craftspeople, tradespeople, and specialists within specific skill areas</li>
					<li><strong>Project Directories:</strong> Connect with people working on particular initiatives or building specific things</li>
					<li><strong>Business Directories:</strong> Discover agorist businesses and services available within the network</li>
					<li><strong>Host Directories:</strong> Locate network hosts offering space for travelers, events, or gatherings</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>What You Can Find in the Directory</h2>
				<p>
					The Directory isn't just a list of names—it's a map of capabilities, resources, and connections. Here's what people typically search for:
				</p>

				<h3>People</h3>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>By skill:</strong> Mechanics, builders, medics, technologists, farmers, craftspeople</li>
						<li><strong>By interest:</strong> Homesteading, off-grid living, business building, education, philosophy</li>
						<li><strong>By location:</strong> Network members near you or in places you're considering moving to</li>
						<li><strong>By role:</strong> Hosts, mentors, educators, caravan members, guild masters</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>How to Search the Directory</h2>
				<p>
					Finding what you need in a decentralized network requires different approaches than searching a centralized database:
				</p>

				<h3>Start With What You Know</h3>
				<p>
					The more specific your search, the better your results:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Instead of:</strong> "Find me community"</li>
					<li><strong>Try:</strong> "Find network members in Colorado interested in homesteading"</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Instead of:</strong> "I need help"</li>
					<li><strong>Try:</strong> "I need a diesel mechanic familiar with converted school buses"</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Search Multiple Ways</h3>
				<p>
					Different directories serve different purposes:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Geographic search:</strong> Start with the <a href="8_maps.html">Network Maps</a> to find people and resources by location</li>
					<li><strong>Skill search:</strong> Check relevant <a href="4_guilds.html">Guild Directories</a> for specialists</li>
					<li><strong>Opportunity search:</strong> Browse the <a href="6_bountyboard.html">Bounty Board</a> for active needs and offerings</li>
					<li><strong>Event search:</strong> Look at upcoming <a href="7_events.html">gatherings</a> where you can meet people in person</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Ask the Network</h3>
				<p>
					Sometimes the best directory is the people you already know:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Post in network channels describing what you're looking for</li>
					<li>Ask at gatherings if anyone knows someone who can help</li>
					<li>Reach out to people in adjacent areas—they often know others nearby</li>
					<li>Contact us directly and we can help connect you with relevant people</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Be Findable Yourself</h3>
				<p>
					The Directory works best when everyone contributes. If you have skills, resources, or offerings—add yourself. The more visible and accessible network members are, the stronger the web of connections becomes.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Directory Etiquette & Best Practices</h2>
				<p>
					Finding people is one thing—reaching out effectively is another. Here's how to make good connections:
				</p>

				<h3>When Reaching Out</h3>
				<div class="callout">
					<p><strong>Do:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Be specific about what you're looking for or offering</li>
						<li>Explain how you found them (which directory, who referred you)</li>
						<li>Respect their response time—people are busy</li>
						<li>Be clear about what you're asking (advice? collaboration? service?)</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Don't:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Send generic mass messages</li>
						<li>Assume availability—ask if they have capacity</li>
						<li>Lead with demands or expectations</li>
						<li>Share their contact info without permission</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<h3>When Being Found</h3>
				<p>
					If you're in the directory and someone reaches out:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Respond even if just to say "not available right now"</li>
					<li>Be clear about your boundaries and capacity</li>
					<li>If you can't help, consider referring them to someone who can</li>
					<li>If someone is disrespectful or violates boundaries, report it</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Building Your Reputation</h3>
				<p>
					The Directory becomes more useful as people build track records:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Follow through on commitments</li>
					<li>Communicate clearly about what you can and can't do</li>
					<li>Update your listing when your capacity or offerings change</li>
					<li>Give references for people you've worked with successfully</li>
					<li>Acknowledge when things don't work out and learn from it</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Privacy & Security Considerations</h2>
				<p>
					The Directory balances accessibility with protection. Here's how we think about it:
				</p>

				<h3>What We Protect</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Specific addresses:</strong> Only general location (city/region) in public directory</li>
					<li><strong>Personal details:</strong> Only information members explicitly choose to share</li>
					<li><strong>Private communications:</strong> Directory facilitates introduction, actual communication happens directly</li>
					<li><strong>Vulnerable members:</strong> Special protections for those facing state harassment or threats</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>What You Control</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Whether to be in the public directory at all</li>
					<li>What name you use (real name or pseudonym)</li>
					<li>How much location detail to share</li>
					<li>What contact methods to offer</li>
					<li>How to describe yourself and your offerings</li>
					<li>When to update or remove your listing</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Operational Security</h3>
				<p>
					For members requiring higher security:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Use pseudonyms in public directory</li>
					<li>Use secure, encrypted communication channels</li>
					<li>Limit location information to region, not city</li>
					<li>Meet new people in public places initially</li>
					<li>Trust your instincts—if something feels off, proceed cautiously</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Specialized Directory Functions</h2>
				<p>
					Beyond basic search, the Directory supports specific network functions:
				</p>

				<h3>Emergency Network</h3>
				<p>
					Vetted members can access emergency contacts for urgent situations:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Safe houses for members fleeing danger</li>
					<li>Emergency medical contacts</li>
					<li>Legal support network</li>
					<li>Security and defense resources</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					This layer is only accessible to thoroughly vetted members and requires demonstrated trustworthiness.
				</p>

				<h3>Caravan Coordination</h3>
				<p>
					The Directory helps traveling members find:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hosts along travel routes</li>
					<li>Services and supplies in unfamiliar areas</li>
					<li>Other travelers for coordination or convoy</li>
					<li>Event locations and gathering points</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Skill Matching</h3>
				<p>
					Connect people who need specific skills with those who have them:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Apprenticeship opportunities</li>
					<li>Mentorship relationships</li>
					<li>Project collaborations</li>
					<li>Teaching and learning exchanges</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Resource Sharing</h3>
				<p>
					Track who has what and facilitate sharing:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Tools and equipment available for loan or rent</li>
					<li>Bulk purchasing coordination</li>
					<li>Seed and plant exchanges</li>
					<li>Knowledge and documentation libraries</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Growing the Directory</h2>
				<p>
					The Directory's usefulness grows exponentially as more people participate. Every member who adds themselves, updates their information, or connects others strengthens the entire network.
				</p>

				<h3>How You Can Contribute</h3>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Add yourself:</strong> Even if you're not sure what you have to offer yet, your presence matters</li>
						<li><strong>Keep information current:</strong> Update your listing as your situation, skills, or offerings change</li>
						<li><strong>Make introductions:</strong> When you know two people who should connect, facilitate that</li>
						<li><strong>Share success stories:</strong> Let others know when directory connections led to good outcomes</li>
						<li><strong>Fill gaps:</strong> If you notice missing skills or resources in your area, consider developing them</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<h3>What Makes a Good Directory Entry</h3>
				<p>
					Useful listings are specific, honest, and actionable:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<p><strong>Vague:</strong> "Interested in community building, sustainability, and freedom. Looking to connect with like-minded people."</p>
					<p><strong>Specific:</strong> "Permaculture designer with 5 years experience. Currently in Oregon, offering consultations and helping establish food forests. Also teaching workshops on rainwater collection and soil building. Looking for land partnerships and apprentices."</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Directory Evolution</h3>
				<p>
					The Directory adapts as the network grows:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>New categories emerge as new needs and offerings develop</li>
					<li>Regional subdirectories form as local networks strengthen</li>
					<li>Specialized directories appear for specific projects or initiatives</li>
					<li>Tools and platforms improve based on member feedback</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Beyond The Directory</h2>
				<p>
					While the Directory is a powerful tool, the deepest connections still happen through in-person interaction. Use the Directory to find people, but build relationships through:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Attending <a href="7_events.html">network gatherings and festivals</a></li>
					<li>Visiting <a href="8_hosts.html">network hosts</a> while traveling</li>
					<li>Participating in <a href="4_guilds.html">guild activities</a> and projects</li>
					<li>Contributing to community initiatives</li>
					<li>Showing up consistently over time</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The Directory tells you who exists and how to reach them. What you build from there depends on the quality of your engagement and the reciprocity you bring to relationships.
				</p>
			</div>
