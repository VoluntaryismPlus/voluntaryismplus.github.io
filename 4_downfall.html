					<strong>Why movies are misleading</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					We may think we are immune to programming. Our
					favorite movies about fighting for a new world may
					have many good aspects, but there are also places
					where they all fall short of what is needed.
				</p>
				<!--
				<p>
					But the most insidious lie
					is the reality that is left out of
					movies and misdirected away from - it
					becomes uncool or scary and as a result,
					we have become culturally blind to
					anarchy.
				</p>
				-->
				<p>
					People might feel like they don&rsquo;t have a lot
					of power and that they can&rsquo;t do much. That
					isn't true, but what is true is that it's almost
					impossible to change the world without others to
					change the world with.
				</p>
				<p>
					We need media that shows examples of how the
					current world is not hopeless and that shows real
					strategies of changing it for good.
				</p>
				<!--
				<p>
					But they can, it
					just takes a willingness to hold
					themselves to the standards. They have
					the power to be gods and should start
					doing so.
				</p>

				<h4>The Matrix</h4>
				<p>To be continued...</p>
				<p>
					People say that the matrix is an
					allegory for life, but what is the
					implication of this? It is either that
					the world we are living in right now is
					not the real world and that we should
					seek an end to our existence in this
					world to begin a life in another more
					real world. Which sounds like Buddhism.
					Christianity with its heaven, or even
					nihilism.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other possible implication would be
					that the matrix is a metaphor for
					humanity being plugged into technology
					like their phones and the Internet. That
					could potentially imply that any
					involvement in industrial society is
					involvement in the matrix, or more
					realistically that any
					government-sanctioned institutions are
					creating a matrix-like existence for
					many who do not realize they are in the
					world manufactured down to their very
					consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					Technology will not be our downfall.
					There are technologists on both sides of
					the fight.
				</p>
				<h4>The Matrix 4</h4>
				<p>To be continued...</p>
				<p>We are living in a world we have 
					constructed for ourselves. </p>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h4>V for Vendetta:&nbsp;</h4>
				<p>
					Sets no example for how to effectively build
					resilient communities, and also says nothing about
					how there are no guns in England.
				</p>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h4>Firefly</h4>
				<p>
					A character who has the most potential as a nomad
					is hindered by the profession she chooses to
					pursue. She was an individual paying her away on a
					ship yet for her job she spent her time in ways
					that were beneath her.&nbsp;
				</p>
			<h4>Star Trek</h4>
				<p>
					In the Star Trek universe, who or what would be
					most analogous to voluntaryists? Would they be
					disgruntled with "the system" Starship-engineers
					or "smugglers"? Would they be heavily-armed
					freedom-defending Space-Gangs that the empire
					falsely accuses of "privacy/piracy?"
