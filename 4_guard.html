      <h3>Personal Security and Self-Reliance Training</h3>

      
        <h4>
          Form your own guard, and become knowledgeable in security, self-defense, wilderness survival, emergency preparedness, first aid, food acquisition skills (like trapping), shelter construction, and more.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Freedom Guard is the Network's training framework for developing the skills needed to protect yourself, your community, and your freedom. It's not a centralized organization with commanders and subordinates—it's a distributed knowledge network where individuals develop competencies, earn recognition through demonstrated ability, and teach others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Get experience at training lands where you can practice skills in safe, supportive environments before you need them in real situations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>
          To equip individuals with the knowledge they need to maximize their individual freedom and liberty through practical skills and preparedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Freedom Guard's aim is to create intentional, focused, coordinated, and extremely skilled groups of individuals who can solve problems quickly, efficiently, and safely. When you have the skills to take care of yourself and others, you don't need to depend on institutions that demand your obedience in exchange for "protection."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Teach classes once you have five specializations.</strong> Knowledge multiplies when shared. Every Guardian who achieves proficiency in five areas becomes a teacher, spreading knowledge throughout the Network.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>What is Freedom Guard?</h2>
        <p>
          Freedom Guard is both a philosophy and a practical training system. It recognizes that true security comes not from delegating your safety to others, but from developing your own capabilities and building networks of mutually skilled individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike traditional security forces with rigid hierarchies and blind obedience, Freedom Guard emphasizes:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Individual competence:</strong> Every person capable of assessing and responding to threats</li>
            <li><strong>Distributed knowledge:</strong> Skills spread throughout the network, not concentrated in specialists</li>
            <li><strong>Voluntary coordination:</strong> Working together because it's effective, not because someone commands it</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-functional training:</strong> Everyone has multiple capabilities rather than single narrow expertise</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous learning:</strong> Skills are developed and refined throughout life</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>It is vital that members of any team have basic cross-functional training and experiences.</strong> A team where everyone can do a little of everything is more resilient than one where individuals are hyper-specialized. If the medic goes down, who treats wounds? If the navigator is incapacitated, who finds the way? Freedom Guard ensures everyone has foundational competence across critical domains.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Badges: Recognition for Demonstrated Competence</h2>
        <p>
          Freedom Guard uses a badge system to recognize skills and accomplishments. Unlike state credentials that require permission and payment, badges are earned through demonstrable competency—you know how to do it, you prove it, you earn recognition.
        </p>

        <h3>Based on Survival</h3>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Forming Your Own Guard</h2>
        <p>
          A "guard" can be one person—you—or a team of individuals committed to mutual protection and skill development. The process is the same whether you're training solo or forming a group.
        </p>

        <h3>Becoming Knowledgeable</h3>
        <p>
          Start by developing foundational competence in three core areas:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Threat assessment, perimeter defense, surveillance detection, operational security</li>
            <li><strong>Self-Defense:</strong> Physical skills for protecting yourself and others from aggression</li>
            <li><strong>Preparedness:</strong> Having supplies, plans, and skills ready for emergencies</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Getting Experience</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Training Lands:</strong> Network properties dedicated to skill development where you can practice in safe environments. These properties offer:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li>Space for wilderness survival practice</li>
            <li>Facilities for self-defense training</li>
            <li>Equipment and tools for learning</li>
            <li>Experienced instructors and mentors</li>
            <li>Community of learners at various skill levels</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Three Tiers of Progression</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Scout:</strong> Beginner level—learning foundational skills, developing awareness, building confidence</li>
            <li><strong>Pioneer:</strong> Intermediate level—proficient in core skills, able to teach basics to others, expanding into specializations</li>
            <li><strong>Guard:</strong> Advanced level—mastery of multiple domains, capable of protecting self and others, active teacher and mentor</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Specializations</h3>
        <p>
          Once you have foundational competence, develop specializations in areas that interest you or meet Network needs:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wilderness Survival:</strong> Deep expertise in living off-grid and off-land</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Preparedness:</strong> Disaster response, supply management, coordination</li>
            <li><strong>First Aid / Medical:</strong> Trauma care, field medicine, long-term health maintenance</li>
            <li><strong>Communications:</strong> Encrypted systems, radio operations, mesh networks</li>
            <li><strong>Tactics:</strong> Strategic thinking, threat assessment, defensive operations</li>
            <li><strong>Weapons Proficiency:</strong> Safe, effective use of defensive tools</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Levels of Freedom Guard</h2>
        <p>
          Advancement through Freedom Guard is based on demonstrated competence and contribution, not time served or paperwork completed. The three levels correspond to increasing ability and responsibility.
        </p>

        <h3>Level One - Cardinal</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Required Proficiencies:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Teach Philosophy of Freedom:</strong> Can explain voluntaryist principles clearly to newcomers</li>
            <li><strong>One Core Skill from a Guard:</strong> Demonstrable competence in at least one of the foundational areas (Security, Self-Defense, or Preparedness)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          At this level, you're transitioning from student to practitioner. You understand why freedom matters and have developed at least one practical skill to protect it.
        </p>

        <h3>Level Two - Fixed</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Required Proficiencies:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Teach Philosophy of Action:</strong> Can guide others from theory to practice—how to actually live free</li>
            <li><strong>Utilization of the Network:</strong> Understand how to leverage Network resources effectively and contribute value back</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Core Skills:</strong> Proficient in at least two of the three foundational areas</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          At this level, you're not just capable yourself—you're making others more capable. You understand how the Network functions and how to be maximally useful within it.
        </p>

        <h3>Level Three - Mutable</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Required Proficiencies:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>All Core Skills:</strong> Mastery of Security, Self-Defense, and Preparedness</li>
            <li><strong>Teach Philosophy of Outreach:</strong> Can effectively spread voluntaryist ideas and recruit others into the Network</li>
            <li><strong>Five+ Specializations:</strong> Deep expertise in multiple domains beyond the fundamentals</li>
            <li><strong>Active Teaching:</strong> Regularly training others and expanding the knowledge base</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          At this level, you're a force multiplier. Your skills, knowledge, and leadership significantly increase the Network's overall capability. The "Mutable" designation recognizes that mastery means adapting to changing circumstances—you don't rigidly follow protocols, you intelligently respond to situations.
        </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choose your first focus area:</strong> Security, Self-Defense, or Preparedness—pick one to start
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Find resources:</strong> Books, online courses, local instructors, Network training lands
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Practice regularly:</strong> Skills atrophy without use—schedule consistent training
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Connect with others:</strong> Find training partners, join or form a guard, learn from those ahead of you
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Earn your first badge:</strong> Demonstrate competence and get recognized
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Teach what you learn:</strong> As soon as you know something well enough, share it
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Don't wait until you're "ready" to start. You become ready by doing. Begin with what you can do today, even if it's just reading a book on wilderness survival or practicing situational awareness during your commute.
