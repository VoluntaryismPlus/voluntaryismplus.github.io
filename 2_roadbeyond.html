					<h3>Leaving Base Camp</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					You've learned the philosophy. You've explored the four pathways. You understand what's possible. Now it's time to leave Freedom Base Camp and enter the real world where theory becomes practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					This page exists for people ready to take physical action—not just browse, but <em>go somewhere</em> and <em>do something</em>. If you're still preparing, that's fine. Return to <a href="2_orientation.html">Camp Orientation</a> or explore <a href="2_compass.html">The Compass Star</a>.
				</p>
			</div>

			<br />

			<!-- READINESS CHECK -->
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>Are You Ready?</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					Taking the road beyond means you're prepared to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Live without conventional housing for at least 2 weeks</li>
					<li>Navigate using maps and network contacts rather than hotels</li>
					<li>Trade using cryptocurrency, precious metals, or barter</li>
					<li>Make decisions without authority figures approving them</li>
					<li>Accept that comfort and safety are your responsibility</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If any of these feel impossible, you're not ready yet. That's not a judgment—it's information. Go back to The Workshop and build the skills you're missing. Most people need 3-6 months of preparation before leaving base camp.
				</p>
			</div>

			<br />

			<!-- THE FOUR EXITS -->
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>Four Ways to Leave Base Camp</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					There are four main routes people take when leaving base camp. Choose based on your current situation, skills, and goals.
				</p>

				<!-- Exit 1: Find Free Land -->
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="headerbox">
						<h2>Exit 1: Find Free Land</h2>
					</div>
					<p><strong>Best for:</strong> People with vehicles, camping gear, and the ability to be self-sufficient for weeks at a time.</p>
					<p>
						Use our maps to locate BLM land, national forests, and other public spaces where you can camp for free. This is the fastest way to eliminate housing costs and begin living outside the system.
					</p>
					<p><strong>What you'll need:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Vehicle (car, van, RV, or motorcycle with gear)</li>
						<li>Basic camping equipment (tent, sleeping bag, water storage)</li>
						<li>Method for obtaining food (cash, EBT, trade goods)</li>
						<li>Navigation tools (maps, GPS, network location listings)</li>
					</ul>

					<a href="5_gear.html" class="button button1">Mobile Gear Guide</a>
				</div>
				<br />

				<!-- Exit 2: Stay With a Host -->
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="headerbox">
						<h2>Exit 2: Stay With a Network Host</h2>
					</div>
					<p><strong>Best for:</strong> People transitioning out of conventional housing who need a temporary base while building income or skills.</p>
					<p>
						Network hosts offer short-term or long-term stays in exchange for work, barter, or small rent payments. This gives you stability while you detach from the old system.
					</p>
					<p><strong>What you'll need:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Communication method to contact hosts (email, Signal)</li>
						<li>Transportation to reach host location</li>
						<li>Skills or goods to offer in exchange</li>
						<li>Understanding of NAP and voluntary agreements</li>
					</ul>

				<br />

				<!-- Exit 3: Join a Caravan -->
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="headerbox">
						<h2>Exit 3: Join a Caravan</h2>
					</div>
					<p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want community, mentorship, and a structured introduction to agorist living.</p>
					<p>
						Join CaravAnarchy or another traveling group. You'll learn by doing—trading at markets, camping on free land, building parallel economy infrastructure, and connecting with hosts across the network.
					</p>
					<p><strong>What you'll need:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Ability to cover your own gas, food, and basic expenses</li>
						<li>Vehicle (or willingness to ride-share and contribute)</li>
						<li>Flexibility to move when the caravan moves</li>
						<li>Skills or labor to contribute to group projects</li>

				<!-- Exit 4: Apply to Inner Realm -->
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="headerbox">
						<h2>Exit 4: Apply to Inner Realm</h2>
					</div>
					<p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who have proven their commitment to agorism and need access to protected network spaces.</p>
					<p>
						The Inner Realm includes private properties, vetted member directories, and spaces where everyone present has been assessed for alignment with NAP principles. Access requires demonstration of values through action.
					</p>
					<p><strong>What you'll need:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Track record of agorist trade or lifestyle</li>
						<li>References from trusted network members</li>
						<li>Understanding of NAP, SDP, and conflict resolution</li>
						<li>Willingness to be vouched for by existing members</li>

			<!-- WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU LEAVE -->
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>What Happens After You Leave?</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					Once you take the road beyond, you're no longer a tourist. You're a participant. Here's what that means:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<p><strong>You become a node in the network.</strong><br />
					Your experiences, trade relationships, and knowledge become valuable to others. You'll be asked to host, mentor, or share what you've learned.</p>
				</div>
				<br />
				<div class="callout">
					<p><strong>You face real challenges.</strong><br />
					Vehicles break down. People disagree. Weather changes plans. You learn to adapt without calling authorities or depending on institutions.</p>
				</div>
				<br />
				<div class="callout">
					<p><strong>You gain real freedom.</strong><br />
					No rent. No boss. No permission slips. You wake up each day and decide what you're building. The cost is comfort. The reward is autonomy.</p>
				</div>
				<br />
				<div class="callout">
					<p><strong>You can always come back to base camp.</strong><br />
					This isn't a one-way door. People return to refresh their knowledge, connect with new members, or take a break from the road. Base camp is always here.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<br />

			<!-- FINAL DECISION POINT -->
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>The Choice Is Yours</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					If you've read this far and you're still hesitating, that's your answer. Go back to <a href="2_compass.html">The Compass Star</a> and spend more time in The Library or Workshop. There's no shame in preparation.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you're ready to act, pick one of the four exits above and take the first concrete step. Email a host. Check a map. Contact the caravan. Apply to the inner realm.
				</p>
				<p>
					The road beyond doesn't end. It's the beginning of everything you came here to find.
