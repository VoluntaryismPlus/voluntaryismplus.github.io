					<h3>Welcome to the Campfire</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					You've arrived at Freedom Base Camp. Around this fire, we'll show you the four pathways people take when leaving the system. Most people need all four—but you can start with whichever one feels most urgent.
				</p>
				<p>
					Think of these as your character stats in the game of building a free life. You're leveling up in: <strong>Money</strong>, <strong>Housing</strong>, <strong>Community</strong>, and <strong>Purpose</strong>.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- THE FOUR PATHWAYS -->
			<div class="innersection panel stack">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>The Four Pathways</h2>
				</div>

				<!-- Pathway 1: Money -->
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="headerbox">
						<h2>💰 Pathway 1: Money Without Masters</h2>
					</div>
					<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Your job funds wars, cage systems, and corruption through taxes. Your labor creates wealth that's stolen before you see it.</p>
					<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Redirect income to agorist sources—work that doesn't fund the state. This includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Trading goods/services in the parallel economy</li>
						<li>Accepting cryptocurrency or precious metals</li>
						<li>Apprenticing in guilds that teach valuable skills</li>
						<li>Fulfilling bounties on the network's board</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>First Step:</strong> Visit The Agora to see what opportunities exist, or read "Agorist Tactics" in The Workshop to understand the economic strategy.</p>
					<a href="6_agora.html" class="button button--primary">Browse Opportunities</a>
					<a href="4_tactics.html" class="button button--primary">Learn Agorist Tactics</a>
				</div>
				

				<!-- Pathway 2: Housing -->
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="headerbox">
						<h2>🏕️ Pathway 2: Housing Without Rent-Seeking</h2>
					</div>
					<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Rent and mortgages trap you in the wage-slave cycle. You work to pay someone else's property taxes while building nothing permanent for yourself.</p>
					<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Find housing that doesn't feed the system. Options include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Staying with network hosts (short or long-term)</li>
						<li>Camping on free public lands (BLM, national forests)</li>
						<li>Mobile living (van, RV, bus conversion)</li>
						<li>Joining intentional communities with voluntary agreements</li>
						<li>Crowdfunding land purchases with trusted network members</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>First Step:</strong> Check the maps for free camping locations, browse network host listings, or learn about nomadic living in The Workshop.</p>
					<a href="8_maps.html" class="button button--primary">View Free Land Maps</a>
					<a href="4_caravans.html" class="button button--primary">Learn Mobile Living</a>
				</div>
				

				<!-- Pathway 3: Community -->
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="headerbox">
						<h2>🤝 Pathway 3: Community Without Hierarchy</h2>
					</div>
					<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Isolation makes you vulnerable. The state wants atomized individuals with no support networks—easier to control, easier to coerce.</p>
					<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Build reciprocal relationships with people who share your values. This includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Attending network meetups and events</li>
						<li>Joining caravans that move between locations</li>
						<li>Connecting with guilds in your trade or interest area</li>
						<li>Hosting or being hosted by trusted network members</li>
						<li>Participating in consensus-based decision making spaces</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>First Step:</strong> Visit Connect to learn about community building, or check events to find gatherings near you.</p>
					<a href="5_connect.html" class="button button--primary">Explore Community</a>
					<a href="7.2_events.html" class="button button--primary">Find Events</a>
				</div>
				

				<!-- Pathway 4: Purpose -->
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="headerbox">
						<h2>🎯 Pathway 4: Purpose Beyond Survival</h2>
					</div>
					<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> The system wants you working just to survive, with no energy left for meaning. You're too tired to ask why you're doing any of this.</p>
					<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Design work around your values and vision. This includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Identifying your skills and how they serve freedom</li>
						<li>Creating your own "character class" in the real-world RPG</li>
						<li>Joining teams working on specific freedom-building projects</li>
						<li>Teaching others skills you've mastered</li>
						<li>Building infrastructure that outlives you</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>First Step:</strong> Read "Rewrite Your Future" to design your path, or explore the Real-World RPG framework in The Workshop.</p>
					<a href="2_rewrite.html" class="button button--primary">Rewrite Your Future</a>
					<a href="4_rpg.html" class="button button--primary">Real-World RPG</a>
				</div>
			</div>

			

			<!-- PROGRESS CHECK -->
			<div class="innersection panel stack">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>Where Are You Now?</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					Most people entering the network are strong in one or two pathways but weak in others. That's normal. The goal isn't perfection—it's progress.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Quick self-assessment:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Money:</strong> What percentage of your income comes from agorist sources?</li>
					<li><strong>Housing:</strong> How much monthly housing cost could you eliminate?</li>
					<li><strong>Community:</strong> Do you have 3+ people you trust in an emergency?</li>
					<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Does your daily work create more freedom for others?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If you scored low on any pathway, that's where to focus next. If you scored high on all four, you're ready to <a href="road_beyond.html">take the road beyond</a> and start building for others.
