        <h3>Your Life as a Strategic Adventure</h3>

        <p>
          You've always been the hero of your own story.
          Now, it's time to play the greatest role-playing
          game of all: your life. The world has long
          presented us with a flawed set of "character
          classes" defined by a broken system of control,
          licenses, and taxes. But what if you could choose
          a new class? What if you could write your own
          story?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not a metaphor; this is how we live. The
          Real-World RPG is our guide to escaping the old
          game and living in the future we want to see in
          our lifetimes. It's an adventure guide to help you
          figure out your next move, full of plans of action
          and resources for collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of playing by the state's rules—where your
          character class is "taxpayer," "employee," or
          "citizen"—you can create your own identity,
          develop genuine skills, and pursue quests that
          actually matter. This framework makes building a
          free life engaging and strategic rather than
          overwhelming.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h2>Create Your Character Class</h2>
        <p>
          The path to becoming the person you want to be is
          a complex quest filled with healing, remembering,
          dreaming, feeling lost, and then coming back again
          and again to what drives you. You were born into a
          world corrupted by prevalent lies, such as the
          existence of "authority over others." But the new
          generation is already eschewing the lie of
          secondary education and finding success outside
          the traditional system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet too often, these stories are framed as
          succeeding <em>despite</em> the system, not by
          creating a new one. That's where the RPG framework
          changes everything—you're not just escaping the
          old game, you're actively building a new one.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Your Character Class is Unique</h4>
          <p>
            In this RPG, you can define your Super Role. You
            can be a Bard, a Rover, a Supplier, or even a
            Green Mage. We are fighting for what we want to
            see in the world. We are teachers, healers, and
            builders. Your character class is a unique
            combination of skills and interests that you
            discover over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a living title—a snapshot of a person who
            is always growing and updating their own
            understanding of who they are and what they are
            here to do. Your class isn't assigned by a
            degree or license—it emerges from what you
            actually do, what skills you develop, and what
            value you create.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Examples of Character Classes:</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>The Trader</strong> - Specializes in
              counter-economic exchange, connecting buyers
              and sellers, moving goods between markets
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Builder</strong> - Creates
              physical infrastructure—homes, workshops,
              tools—that enable freedom
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Healer</strong> - Provides medical
              care, emotional support, or conflict
              resolution without state involvement
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Teacher</strong> - Shares
              knowledge and skills outside institutional
              education
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Guardian</strong> - Provides
              security, trains others in self-defense,
              maintains protective capability
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Innovator</strong> - Develops new
              tools, techniques, and solutions to problems
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Connector</strong> - Builds
              networks, facilitates introductions, organizes
              gatherings
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Storyteller</strong> - Creates
              media, art, and narratives that spread freedom
              ideas
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          You're not limited to one class. You might be a
          Builder-Trader who creates furniture and sells it
          in grey markets. Or a Teacher-Guardian who trains
          people in both philosophy and self-defense. The
          combinations are endless, and they should reflect
          your actual interests and capabilities—not what
          some institution says you're allowed to do.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h2>Discover Your Superpowers</h2>
        <p>
          In this new context, the things you can do when
          you are not held back by the state can be seen as
          superpowers. We can do things alone and in groups
          that are beyond our current conception of what is
          possible. Your powers are many, including:
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Your Available Superpowers:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Uprooting:</strong> The ability to
              uproot and start a new life at any time. This
              was a challenge in the past, but with our
              Network, you can literally redefine your
              location and community whenever you choose.
              Geographic freedom is a superpower most people
              don't realize they have.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Decentralized Connection:</strong> The
              ability to connect with others who share
              common interests, no matter how far away they
              are, bypassing centralized platforms and
              surveillance. You can build genuine community
              across continents.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tangible Creation:</strong> The power
              to produce real value with your hands and
              mind—to create goods, services, and solutions
              that people actually want without asking
              permission from regulators.
            </li>

                >Broadened Mobilization and
                Convergence:</strong
              >
              The power to overcome the limitations of
              physical distance, establish multiple trade
              networks, and create tangible change for
              yourself and those you trust. You can
              coordinate complex activities across
              distributed networks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resilience:</strong> The power to
              adapt and endure. By connecting with our
              network, you are no longer dependent on a
              single source for your needs, and thus are
              more protected from regional supply failures
              and weaknesses. Redundancy is resilience.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          These are not inherited traits but skills you
          develop by shedding the old system. Each power you
          master adds a new dimension to your character and
          makes you a formidable force in building the free
          world. Unlike video game characters, you're not
          limited by arbitrary level caps or skill trees—you
          can develop any capability you're willing to work
          for.

        <h2>Tools of Innovation</h2>
        <p>
          We wield special tools that were inconceivable
          just 100 years ago, giving us an unprecedented
          advantage in building a new world. These aren't
          just gadgets; they are the fundamental tools of
          our revolution, making freedom more achievable
          than ever before.

          <h4>Game-Changing Technology:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>The Internet:</strong> A
              decentralized, global network that allows for
              instant communication, trade, and knowledge
              sharing, bypassing traditional gatekeepers.
              Information wants to be free—and now it can
              be.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Recording Devices:</strong> The power
              to document truth and expose coercion,
              ensuring that events can be witnessed and
              shared on a global scale. Accountability
              through transparency.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Encrypted Messaging:</strong>
              Unbreakable private communication that allows
              individuals and groups to organize, trade, and
              plan securely, without fear of surveillance.
              Privacy as a defensive superpower.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mobile Vehicles:</strong> The freedom
              to uproot and transcend location, allowing us
              to build flexible, nomadic communities and
              establish networks in any environment. Your
              home can move with you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cryptocurrency:</strong> Money that
              exists outside state control, enabling truly
              voluntary exchange and protecting wealth from
              inflation and seizure.

          By embracing these tools and powers, you transform
          from a mere subject into a sovereign player in the
          game of life. They are the keys to unlocking a
          reality with limitless potential. Our ancestors
          fought for freedom with swords and muskets. We
          have exponentially more powerful tools—we just

          Whether you resonate with the flavor of medieval

          steampunk explorers, you can create the reality
          you want. See the world as a challenge where you

          You can be a better version of any profession.
          Instead of being a slave to a system, you can be a
          Ranger for Light. Instead of a state-sanctioned
          doctor, you can be a Healer. Our chosen
          professions have been stunted by a lack of
          innovation caused by the stifling of the free
          market, but in this RPG, every field is liberated

        <h2>The Power of Story</h2>
        <p>
          Tell yourself the most powerful story about who
          you are and what role you play in the larger story
          of the human race. Contextualize your past—your
          moments of weakness and success—as part of your
          character's journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not a game you just play; it's how we
          live. We are acting as our own best characters in
          the roles we want to fill in the world that we
          want to exist in. We are bringing the lore and the
          language to society, and through every
          interaction, we are cultivating the best possible
          awareness of what is possible if we all just
          worked together.
        </p>

          <h4>Your Character Arc:</h4>
          <p>
            Every hero's journey includes setbacks,
            learning, growth, and transformation. Your past
            mistakes aren't failures—they're part of your
            origin story. That job you hated? That's your
            "before" story, showing how you were trapped in
            the old game. Your current struggles? Those are
            your trials, developing the strength you need
            for later challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key is to see yourself as the protagonist
            actively writing your story, not a background
            character in someone else's narrative. You're
            not waiting for the world to change—you're the
            person making it change.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Frame your life as an ongoing adventure with clear
          objectives, meaningful challenges, and real
          stakes. When you approach freedom-building this
          way, it stops being abstract philosophy and
          becomes an engaging quest with tangible progress
          markers.

        <h2>Positive Self-Programming</h2>
        <p>
          This guide is designed for self-owned
          individuals—everyone, really. Take only what you
          can use and discard the rest. The only rule is the
          Non-Aggression Principle, which will protect you
          in the unsteady waters of a statist world.
        </p>
        <p>
          By adhering to it, you are making a commitment to
          harm none with your actions. This is how you stay
          in character and build a world based on consent,
          not coercion. The NAP isn't a limitation on your
          power—it's the foundation of sustainable power.
          Force creates enemies; voluntary cooperation
          creates allies.
