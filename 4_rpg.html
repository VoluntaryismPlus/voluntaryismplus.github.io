      <h1>Real-World RPG</h1>
      <div class="innersection">
        <p>
          You've always been the hero of your own story.
          Now, it's time to play the greatest role-playing
          game of all: your life. The world has long
          presented us with a flawed set of "character
          classes" defined by a broken system of control,
          licenses, and taxes. But what if you could choose
          a new class? What if you could write your own
          story?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not a metaphor; this is how we live. The
          Real-World RPG is our guide to escaping the old
          game and living in the utopia we want to see in
          our lifetimes. It’s an adventure guide to help you
          figure out your next move, full of plans of action
          and resources for collaboration.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="innersection">
        <h3>Create Your Character Class</h3>
        <p>
          The path to becoming the person you want to be is
          a complex quest filled with healing, remembering,
          dreaming, feeling lost, and then coming back again
          and again to what it is that drives you. You were
          born into a world corrupted by prevalent lies,
          such as the existence of "authority over others."
          But the new generation is already eschewing the
          lie of secondary education and finding success
          outside the traditional system. Yet, too often,
          these stories are framed as succeeding despite the
          system, not by creating a new one.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this RPG, you can define your Super Role. You
          can be a Bard, a Rover, a Supplier, or even a
          Green Mage. We are the Freedom Guard, fighting for
          what we want. We are teachers, healers, and
          builders. Your character class is a unique
          combination of skills and interests that you
          discover over time. It's a living title—a snapshot
          of a person who is always growing and updating
          their own understanding of who they are and what
          they are here to do.
        </p>

        <h3>Discover Your Superpowers</h3>
        <p>
          In this new context, the things you can do when
          you are not held back by the state can be seen as
          superpowers. We can do things alone and in groups
          that are beyond our current conception of what is
          possible. Your powers include:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Uprooting:</strong> The ability to
              uproot and start a new life at any time. This
              was a challenge in the past, but with our
              Network, you can literally redefine your
              location and community whenever you choose.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Decentralized Connection:</strong>
              We are able to connect with others who share
              our interests, no matter how far away they
              are, bypassing centralized platforms and
              surveillance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Technological Mastery:</strong>
              We wield special tools that were inconceivable
              just 100 years ago, including The Internet,
              recording devices, encrypted messaging, and
              mobile vehicles. These are the tools of our
              revolution.

          </ul>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h3>Choose Your Adventure Class</h3>
        <p>
          Whether you resonate with the flavor of medieval
          knights, peaceful vikings, or even futuristic
          steampunk explorers, you can create the reality
          you want. See the world as a challenge where you
          have more power to make a new reality than anyone
          did in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can be a better version of any profession.
          Instead of being a slave to a system, you can be a
          Ranger for Light. Instead of a state-sanctioned
          doctor, you can be a Healer. Our chosen
          professions have been stunted by a lack of
          innovation caused by the stifling of the free
          market, but in this RPG, every field is liberated
          by true communication and collaboration.

        <h3>Assemble Your Super Team</h3>
        <p>
          What can humans really do together when we are
          truly free? In the old game, we were siloed and
          isolated. In this new game, we can assemble Super
          Teams to take on any challenge. The power of human
          collaboration is limitless when guided by consent
          and mutual aid. This guide is full of resources
          and plans of action to find your team.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="innersection">
        <h3>The Power of Story</h3>
        <p>
          Tell yourself the most powerful story about who
          you are and what role you play in the larger story
          of the human race. Contextualize your past—your
          moments of weakness and success—as part of your
          character’s journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not a game you just play; it's how we
          live. We are acting as our own best characters in
          the roles we want to be in the world that we want
          to exist in. We are bringing the lore and the
          language to society, and through every
          interaction, we are cultivating the best possible
          awareness of what is possible if we all just
          worked together.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="innersection">
        <h3>Positive Self-Programming</h3>
        <p>
          This guide is designed for self-owned
          individuals—everyone, really. Take only what you
          can use and discard the rest. The only rule is the
          Non-Aggression Principle, which will protect you
          in the unsteady waters of a statist world. By
          adhering to it, you are making a commitment to
          harm none with your actions. This is how you stay
          in character and build a world based on consent,
          not coercion.
