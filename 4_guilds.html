      <h3>Skill-Based Voluntary Associations</h3>

      
        <p>
          A guild within the Network is a voluntary association of individuals who share a common trade, craft, skill, or area of knowledge. Unlike traditional, state-sanctioned guilds, ours operate on principles of consent, mutual aid, and decentralized collaboration. They are living examples of how expertise can flourish and be shared in a free society, providing essential services and fostering innovation outside coercive systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guilds are an essential, dynamic component of the Network, designed to empower individuals and strengthen our collective pursuit of freedom. Born from voluntary association, they unite people around shared trades and passions, offering pathways for growth and collaboration and providing unparalleled opportunities for skill acquisition and practical experience outside traditional systems.
        </p>
        <h4>
          How many skills would you pursue if you had access to paid training or free learning on any subject you desired?
        </h4>
        <p>
          There will be voluntary structures that benefit people in different trades. They will be organic, but our network favors those which adhere to certain principles. These are Guilds. We divide these into two tiers which, between the two, provide opportunities for growth in a myriad of modalities. If you can't find the Guild you want, you can be the one to create the next great Guild.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guilds provide members with access to benefits, such as exclusive access to jobs, bounties, and Guild properties.
        </p>

        <h2>Inner Guilds</h2>
        <p>
          Inner Guilds fulfill a number of requirements which other Guilds do not necessarily follow. They must allow for learning and movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Guild is organized by those within the Guild. They are decided by unanimous consent by default. That can change but as such the status of the Guild might shift. All Guilds, inner and outer, must adhere to the Non-Aggression Principle and seek to attain higher levels of anarchy in all interactions and transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inner Guilds accommodate people who are in these categories:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Intermediary:</strong> Mid-level practitioners bridging beginners and masters</li>
            <li><strong>Intermittent:</strong> Those who participate occasionally rather than full-time</li>
            <li><strong>Interdisciplinary:</strong> People pursuing multiple trades or combining skills</li>
            <li><strong>Noncommittal:</strong> Exploring without long-term obligation</li>
            <li><strong>Beginner:</strong> Just starting to learn the trade</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Four Core Principles of Inner Guilds</h3>
        <p>
          An Inner Guild must adhere to these four core principles:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h5>They must accept new members.</h5>
              <p>No closed door policy—anyone genuinely interested in learning the trade can join.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>They must accept auditors, meaning those who want to learn.</h5>
              <p>People can observe and learn without full membership commitment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>They must have a process of accepting inter-Guild ambassadors, students, and collaborations.</h5>
              <p>Guilds don't operate in isolation—they cooperate and share knowledge across trades.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>The above three must be determined at the discretion of the entire Guild with unanimous consent.</h5>
              <p>The Guild collectively decides how to implement these principles, not a single leader.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p>
          If a Guild by unanimous consent decides to not adhere to one of the core principles, but still desires to adhere to the Non-Aggression Principle and conduct trade with other anarchists, they may be considered an Outer Guild.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="outerimage">
        <img src="img/guilds.jpeg" />
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Outer Guilds</h2>
        <p>
          Any Guild that does not wish to adhere to one or more of the four core principles but still adheres to the Non-Aggression Principle and does not involve the state may be considered an Outer Guild. They will still be listed in our literature and welcomed in the Agora.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, newer Guilds or Guilds that are duplicate and not as large as other Inner Guilds may also be considered an Outer Guild until they reach a certain size or maturity.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Examples of Outer Guilds:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Master-only guilds:</strong> Requiring certain skill level before entry</li>
            <li><strong>Closed membership guilds:</strong> Limited slots for quality control or resource constraints</li>
            <li><strong>Specialized guilds:</strong> Serving niche markets with specific entry requirements</li>
            <li><strong>New guilds:</strong> Still developing their structure and capacity</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          Outer Guild status isn't a value judgment—it's a categorization. Both Inner and Outer Guilds serve important functions in the Network ecosystem.
        </p>

        <h2>What Guilds Bring to the Network</h2>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Support for the Community:</strong> Skilled members available to help with projects and problems</li>
            <li><strong>Wealth to the Community:</strong> Economic activity stays within the Network rather than feeding external systems</li>
            <li><strong>Occupations for People:</strong> Paths to earning income through valuable work</li>
            <li><strong>Occupational and Interdisciplinary Development:</strong> Continuous learning and skill cross-pollination</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>How Guilds are Run</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Community organized and run:</strong> No external hierarchy imposed from above</li>
            <li><strong>Common four core principles and NAP:</strong> Shared foundation across all Guilds</li>
            <li><strong>Unanimous consent by default:</strong> Major decisions require everyone's agreement</li>
            <li><strong>Transparent processes:</strong> Members understand how decisions are made</li>
            <li><strong>Reputation-based advancement:</strong> Progress through demonstrated competence, not credentials</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Agorist Hosts and Guilds</h2>
        <p>
          A person's time at an agorist host location can lead them into a Guild. Hosts often have specific trades or skills they practice, and guests who show interest and aptitude can transition from visitor to apprentice to full Guild member.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Determine: How far have you walked down the path? How far can you speak the language?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Your progression in a Guild isn't about how long you've been a member—it's about demonstrated competence and contribution. Some people advance quickly through natural talent and dedicated practice. Others take years but master the fundamentals thoroughly. Both paths are valid.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Requirements and Benefits:</h4>
          <p>
            To enter Tier 2, there are certain core achievements one attains, alongside any achievements their specific Guild may consider minimum requirements for advancement.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Barter freely with other Guild members (trusted for fair dealing)</li>

          <p>
            While not explicitly detailed here, most Guilds develop a third tier for those who've achieved mastery—individuals who can teach the trade, develop innovations, and serve as Guild representatives to the broader Network.
