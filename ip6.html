          Step Six: How to Maintain a Good Relationship
        </h2>
        <p>
          Keeping a relationship going strong is a part of
          the relational process that is often overlooked.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you follow this course, you have already laid
          the groundwork for creating a relationship that is
          secure, loving, and based on mutual respect and
          acknowledgement of each partner's needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the work is not done yet. You need to make
          sure that neither partner has beliefs that will
          eventually undermine your happiness as a couple
          and create resentment that could lead to the
          dissolution of your relationship.

              The Honeymoon Period<br /><br />
              <p>
                This is the idea of a period of time at the
                beginning of a relationship where a couple
                is more happy because they just met and
                haven't had many arguments or
                dissappointments yet.
              </p>
              <p>
                In reality, the honeymoon period describes
                the inevitable downfall of an unhealthy
                relationship that was initiated too hastily
                and without the proper process or
                expectation setting.
              </p>
              <p>
                With proper care, the honeymoon phase never
                needs to end. If you are authentic, you can
                take constant joy in the process of
                expressing your true self with someone who
                supports and loves you.

              Inevitable Boredom or the "Need for Variety"
              <br /><br />

              <p>
                Avoiding stagnation in a relationship is
                important. If you are not growing or
                changing in any specific area, your partner
                might become weary of interacting with your
                patterns.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the idea that any relationship will
                become stale without introducing foreign
                people or situations into the mix is not
                true.
              </p>
              <p>
                If someone is not excited about the prospect
                of being with just one person, they have not
                yet met the person who will interest them to
                no end. They should not be in a relationship
                until they meet this person.
              </p>

        <h3>Change is Good</h3>
        <p>
          There is a difference I take to the common
          rhetoric that “you should not try to change your
          partner, just accept them as they are”.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that most change is good (see my
          explanation of good and bad
          <a href="ip3.html">here</a>), if only as a
          stepping stone to a further change down the line.
          I also assert that if you are a good person, the
          changes you want to see in your partner will not
          go against who they are, but will instead enhance
          who they are and your relationship as a result.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <h5>Ask Yourself:</h5>
          <p>
            Are there any changes I want my partner to make
            that would not serve them better and help them
            become the person they want to be?
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          After that, ask your partner the same question,
          and see if you can identify any misunderstandings
          you have about why they do what they do. They
          might also learn more about why you believe the
          changes you want for them would be good for them
          from your perspective and current understanding.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="innersection">
        <h3>Addressing Issues</h3>
        <p>
          Everything that comes up for either partner is
          important to discuss. It is very unhealthy for a
          relationship if one partner does not want to
          discuss certain issues the other partner has.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each issue holds within it an opportunity for the
          couple to grow closer. If not addressed, you
          become less of a partnership.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="innersection">
        <h3>Updating Expectations</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="innersection">
        <h3>Troubles in Paradise</h3>
        <p>
          So what if the partner turns out not to be the
          right person for you, or if they were the right
          one but then they changed?
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure to give them the chance to salvage the
          relationship. This does not mean give a chance to
          someone who is physically abusive or addicted to a
          vice that they are lying about. This also does not
          mean give multiple chances to someone who is not
          changing. Make a list of things the person can do
          to get back into a good place with you and be
          prepared to leave if they cannot or will not
          follow through.
        </p>
        <p>What if you changed?</p>
        <p>
          If you value the relationship, you should try to
          change in a way that does not alienate the
          relationship but instead allows your partner to
          choose to come along with you. The relationship is
          not the enemy, it did not create the situation you
          are in. You created the relationship, and you can
          adjust it to better suit your needs if your
          partner is willing to update the contract as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          This goes back to the initial agreement. You can
          plan for most things that come up naturally in the
          course of a person's life as they change and grow,
          but in the case of lies or hidden parts that come
          out, that is a breach of the initial contract and
          trust will need to be re-forged.
