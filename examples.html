				<h2>Jericho</h2>
				<h5>11,000 B.C.E. - 9,000 B.C.E.</h5>
				<p>
					The early settlement of Jericho, one of the oldest
					continuously inhabited cities in the world,
					provides a fascinating glimpse into pre-state
					social organization. During its early Neolithic
					phases, particularly the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A
					and B periods, archaeological evidence suggests a
					society that lacked the hallmarks of a
					centralized, coercive state. While walls were
					built, likely for defense against external threats
					or to manage resources, there is little indication
					of a hierarchical political structure, a ruling
					elite, or a standing army enforcing laws.
					Decisions regarding community projects, resource
					allocation, and conflict resolution appear to have
					been made communally or through informal,
					decentralized mechanisms, demonstrating a capacity
					for complex social organization without the need
					for a dominating state apparatus.
				</p>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="img/Jericho.png" />
				</div>
				<h3>Dates</h3>
				<p>
					11,000 B.C.E. - 9,000 B.C.E. are a good general
					range for its early, pre-state phases. Some
					sources might extend the initial settlement
					slightly earlier, or the later phases of this
					non-state period slightly later.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k</h2>
				<h5>7500 B.C. - 6400 B.C.</h5>
				<p>
					The Neolithic settlement of Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k in Anatolia
					is renowned for its unique urban layout and social
					structure, which challenges conventional
					understandings of early civilization. For over a
					millennium, its inhabitants lived in closely
					packed, interconnected dwellings with no
					discernible streets or public buildings.
					Crucially, archaeological excavations have
					revealed a striking lack of evidence for social
					stratification, such as differences in housing
					size, burial goods, or monumental architecture
					dedicated to a ruler or deity. There are no signs
					of a central authority, a ruling class, or
					specialized institutions for governance or law
					enforcement. Instead, decisions and social order
					appear to have been maintained through horizontal
					relationships, shared cultural norms, and
					localized family or clan structures, highlighting
					a complex and thriving society that operated
					without the presence of a coercive state.
				</p>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="img/Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k.png" />
				</div>
				<h3>Dates</h3>
				<p>
					7500 B.C. - 6400 B.C. are the main Neolithic
					occupation of the eastern mound, which is the
					primary focus for its anarchist-like
					characteristics. UNESCO and other sources
					generally cite 7400 BC to 6200 BC for this phase.
				</p>

				<h2>Xeer Legal system</h2>
				<h5>Somalia</h5>
				<h5>600 C.E. - 1600 C.E.</h5>
				<p>
					For centuries, much of Somali society has operated
					under the Xeer legal system, a customary law
					tradition that exemplifies a decentralized,
					stateless form of governance. Rather than relying
					on a central government or judiciary, Xeer is a
					complex body of unwritten laws, agreements, and
					social contracts negotiated and enforced by
					elders, clan councils, and ad hoc assemblies.
					Disputes are resolved through mediation,
					compensation, and negotiation, with strong social
					pressures and clan honor acting as primary
					enforcement mechanisms. This system operates
					without prisons, police forces, or a formalized
					state bureaucracy, demonstrating how a society can
					maintain order, resolve conflicts, and regulate
					social interactions through voluntary agreements
					and community-based enforcement, underscoring a
					profound absence of a centralized, coercive state.
				</p>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="img/Somalia.png" />
				</div>
				<h3>Dates</h3>
				<p>
					600 C.E. - 1600 C.E. is a good representation of
					its long historical use. However, it's important
					to note that Xeer is still actively used in many
					parts of Somalia today, especially in rural areas,
					and has been recognized by UNESCO as "intangible
					cultural heritage." So, while your historical
					range is correct for its prominent past, its
					influence extends to the present. For the purpose
					of historical examples, 600 C.E. - present or 600
					C.E. - 21st century might be more accurate if you
					want to emphasize its continuity, but for a
					"period" of practice, 1600 C.E. is fine as a
					historical end point. I will keep it as 1600 CE as
					that was your specified end point for the period.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Brehon Law</h2>
				<h5>600 C.E. - 1600 C.E.</h5>
				<p>
					Brehon Law, the indigenous legal system of Ireland
					before the Norman invasion, provides a compelling
					historical example of a highly sophisticated legal
					framework operating without a centralized state.
					Rather than a king or government dictating laws,
					Brehon Law was administered by brehons (jurists)
					who were highly respected legal experts. These
					brehons did not make law but interpreted and
					applied a vast body of customary laws, precedents,
					and legal principles. Enforcement was largely
					decentralized, relying on social pressure,
					reputation, and the payment of fines or
					restitution. There was no standing army or police
					force to compel compliance; instead, a person's
					honor and the collective pressure of their kin
					group ensured adherence. This system fostered a
					society where justice was delivered through a
					highly developed legal scholarship and community
					accountability, rather than through the coercive
					power of a state.
				</p>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="img/Ireland.png" />
				</div>
				<h3>Dates</h3>
				<p>
					While its origins are much older (pre-history),
					the written legal texts and its formalized system
					as we understand it largely developed from the 7th
					and 8th centuries CE, and it was suppressed by the
					English Crown in the 17th century (around 1600
					CE).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Icelandic Commonwealth</h2>
				<h5>930 C.E. - 1262 C.E.</h5>
				<p>
					The Icelandic Commonwealth stands as a remarkable
					historical example of a society that functioned
					for over four centuries without a centralized
					executive authority or a standing army. Power was
					distributed among chieftains (goÃ°ar) who held both
					religious and legal influence, but their power was
					derived from the voluntary allegiance of their
					followers, not from a coercive state apparatus.
					The Althing, a national assembly, served as a
					legislative and judicial body where laws were
					debated and disputes resolved, but it lacked any
					executive power to enforce its rulings.
					Enforcement relied primarily on private legal
					action, arbitration, and the social pressure of
					the community. This period in Icelandic history is
					often cited as a prime example of a functioning
					anarchist society, demonstrating how complex
					social order could be maintained through
					decentralized governance, voluntary association,
					and an elaborate legal system without the presence
					of a coercive state.
				</p>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="img/Iceland.png" />
				</div>
				<h3>Dates</h3>
				<p>
					The settlement is conventionally dated to 874 CE,
					and the Commonwealth itself is often considered to
					have formally begun in 930 CE with the
					establishment of the Althing. Its end is typically
					marked by the "Old Covenant" (Gamli sÃ¡ttmÃ¡li) in
					1262-1264 CE, which saw Icelanders pledging
					allegiance to the Norwegian king, and the adoption
					of the JÃ³nsbÃ³k law code in 1281 CE. So, the period
					930 C.E. - 1262 C.E. is perhaps a more precise
					range for the Commonwealth as a distinct political
					entity, though your range covers the broader
					period of its existence before full subjugation.
					For the purpose of focusing on the "commonwealth"
					part, I would lean towards 930 C.E. - 1262 C.E.
				</p>

				<h2>Neutral Moresnet</h2>
				<h5>1816 C.E. - 1919 C.E.</h5>
				<p>
					Neutral Moresnet, a tiny condominium administered
					jointly by the Netherlands (and later Belgium) and
					Prussia (and later Germany), existed for over a
					century with a remarkably decentralized and
					largely self-governing character. Formed due to a
					border dispute, neither larger power fully
					asserted its control, leading to a unique
					situation where the local population largely
					managed its own affairs. While there were nominal
					administrators from the co-ruling powers, the
					community developed a strong sense of autonomy,
					with little direct interference or coercive state
					presence. Local committees, communal
					decision-making, and a pragmatic approach to
					governance meant that for decades, this small
					territory operated with minimal centralized
					authority, showcasing how a community can thrive
					and maintain order with a significant absence of a
					formal, powerful state apparatus, particularly
					notable for the rise of Esperanto as a potential
					official language in the early 20th century,
					further highlighting its unique, non-state
					character.
				</p>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="img/Moresnet.png" />
				</div>
				<h3>Dates</h3>
				<p>
					The territory was established in 1816 and its
					unique status was formally ended by the Treaty of
					Versailles in 1919, which became effective in 1920
					or 1921 depending on the exact administrative
					transfer. So, 1816 C.E. - 1919 C.E. (or even
					1920/1921 if you want to be super precise about
					the ultimate end of its status) is correct.
