						Of Truth</strong

				</h2>
			</div>
			<p>
				Directionality is a philosophy that can be described
				in simple terms: We are able to conceptualize and
				act upon the best possible model for our lives in
				each moment. We must be able to reassess our
				conclusions, as well as our methods for reaching
				conclusions, without losing the thread of reality or
				the ability to learn and grow from experience.
				Methods and conclusions are only stepping stones on
				the journey but no one stone can define the journey
				itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				Directionality creates temporary islands of truth
				for one to jump between. It prescribes each
				individual to use their own judgment to make
				conclusions, each containing its own temporary rules
				and prescritions.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>
				It makes sense to start one&rsquo;s philosophy from
				the assumption that this world is not a fake,
				projected &ldquo;matrix&rdquo; to be escaped from,
				but instead, that the best course of action is to
				assume that the world is something we can facilitate
				in embodying its best possible form. The current
				limitations will be transcended eventually, and with
				enough concerted effort in a positive direction,
				that eventuality should be able to come relatively
				soon.
			</p>
			<p>
				Directionality means there are islands of truth.
				Though we might not have the perfect grasp upon
				them, there are still real things/temporary facts
				that can be temporarily agreed upon and used as
				temporary variables in other discussions. The final
				truth to any one question does not need to be
				attained for there to be an agreed-upon temporary
				definition of one thing or another. If we use
				logical axioms and never stray into suppositions,
				there can still be a contractual language that makes
				sense.

				The answer is to maintain a methodology for your
				life that allows you to constantly update yourself
				along with the very methodology you use.

				With Directionality, you are using a higher order to
				organize how you recycle methodologies, holding a
				self-determined and clear goal as the highest
				priority around which you organize your decisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Directionality is about concluding the next course
				of action based on the currently known variables.
				The only worthwhile questions are those whose answer
				affects what we do with our lives. Directionality
				says the distinction is only necessary when it
				affects how you choose to act in the world. And I
				take that one step further, to say that the path to
				answering these deep questions should be guided by
				the comparable value of the outcome in your life
				each different answer would elicit.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you are trying to figure out the answer to deep
				questions, you should look to how each possible
				answer would affect your life - and choose the
				answer that gives you the best life.
			</p>
			<p>
				The nihilist life-disaffirming ideologies currently
				fighting for purchase in the world cannot prevail if
				we replace vapid nothingness with purpose and
				meaning. Living our own lives can be fulfilling and
				life-changing for millions who will later join or
				support the cause we are presenting/spearheading
				here.

				<strong
					>How to move forward by holding onto values but
					not conclusions.</strong
				>
			</h4>
			<p>
				The person who thinks there is no way of determining
				the positive or negative value of anything has
				failed to recognize that any decision requires
				judgment. Life is a series of choices, and to choose
				implies you have made a judgment on at least one
				variable as being better or worse than another. The
				important thing to remember is that you do not need
				to hold onto that judgment indefinitely. You came to
				the conclusion based on your information and values
				at one point in time, but those must change as you
				gain more experiences.
			</p>
			<p>
				In life, it is good to be open to change, but the
				way it is done is important. In order to trust your
				own judgement, you must maintain an opinion on at
				least one thing while you change your mind on
				others. Holding to a current hypothesis, one can
				jump from old ground to new ground, able to leave
				previously used notions behind while maintaining
				continuity of mind.
			</p>
			<p>
				We must maintain a reference to at least one thing
				as we move from one lilypad of understanding to the
				next. But we do not need to retain loyalty to any
				thought or opinion any longer than it serves us.
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe we owe it to ourselves to do the best we
				can for that which we care about based on our
				current information and to constantly derive new
				ways of gaining and processing information.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is a fear some hold of judging something as
				good or bad. My philosophy allows for good and bad
				as they relate to real values like health and
				well-being. It is directedness, as a philosophy. It
				gives a way to imagine the best categorization of
				topics. Directionality does not limit reality but
				instead works with what is possible.
