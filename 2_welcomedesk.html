			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>Your Entry Point to the Network</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					The Welcome Desk is your first stop for understanding how the Network operates and where you fit within it. Whether you're exploring freedom for the first time or ready to take concrete action, this page will help you understand the Network's structure and how to navigate it effectively.
				</p>
				<p>
					Think of the Welcome Desk as the lobby of Freedom Base Camp—it's where you get oriented, learn the layout, and decide which direction to head next.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>How to Get Started</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					Your journey into the Network typically follows one of these paths:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>New to voluntaryism and agorism?</strong><br>
						Start with <a href="1_orientation.html">Camp Orientation</a> to understand the four pathways: Wealth, Housing, Community, and Purpose. These give you practical action steps for building a free life.</li>
						
						<li><strong>Want to understand the philosophy?</strong><br>
						Visit <a href="3_library.html">The Library</a> to explore voluntaryism, agorism, and the principles behind living without state control.</li>
						
						<li><strong>Ready to connect with others?</strong><br>
						Check <a href="2_structure.html">Network Structure</a> to understand how trust levels and realms work, then visit <a href="5_adventure.html">The Adventurer's Hall</a> to start building relationships.</li>
						
						<li><strong>Looking for immediate opportunities?</strong><br>
						Go straight to <a href="6_agora.html">The Agora</a> to browse events, bounties, and host locations where you can participate today.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
					Most people benefit from starting with Camp Orientation to get the big picture, then diving deeper into specific areas that match their current needs and goals.
				</p>

				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>Understanding Network Realms</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					The Network operates across three distinct "realms"—concentric circles of trust, access, and engagement. Understanding these realms helps you navigate where you are now and what opportunities become available as you build trust and demonstrate alignment with Network principles.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>Realm Boundaries</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="imagenoborder">
					<a href="2_structure.html"
						><img src="img/Realms.png"
					/></a>
				</div>
				<p>
					The Network's three realms create a progressive system where trust is earned through action and demonstrated values, not demanded upfront.
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>Inner Realm: Protected Spaces for Trusted Members</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					The Inner Realm operates on one fundamental rule: <strong>no rulers, no coercion</strong>. This is where the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP) isn't just philosophy—it's the lived reality that governs every interaction.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Inner Realm includes private properties, vetted member directories, secure communication channels, and spaces where everyone present has been assessed for alignment with voluntaryist principles. We protect these spaces carefully because some things in life need protection. While risk is inherent to freedom, we don't need to risk everything by allowing unvetted individuals into our most vulnerable spaces.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>How to access the Inner Realm:</strong> Entry is through the <a href="4_admissions.html">Admissions Portal</a>. You can establish yourself as a trusted member by:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>Staying with and being vouched for by a Network Host</li>
						<li>Joining a caravan and demonstrating values through daily action</li>
						<li>Participating in Network events and building relationships over time</li>
						<li>Contributing meaningfully to Network projects or infrastructure</li>
						<li>Studying materials in The Library and demonstrating understanding of NAP principles</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
					You can apply for Inner Realm access at any time, but understand that trust must be earned—it cannot be demanded or purchased.
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>Inter Realm: Where Movement Meets Market</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					The Inter Realm is where the Network becomes visible and accessible. Wherever caravans travel, temporary marketplaces are established, workshops happen, and new connections are made. This is the space between the open world and the protected inner circle—a meeting ground where freedom-seekers can encounter the Network in action.
				</p>
				<p>
					Inter Realm locations include:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>Caravan base camps and temporary market locations</li>
						<li>Public Network events and festivals</li>
						<li>Agorist marketplaces and trade gatherings</li>
						<li>Workshop and skills-sharing events</li>
						<li>Welcome outposts in cities along trade routes</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
					The Inter Realm serves multiple purposes: it introduces people to voluntaryist ideas, provides access to agorist goods and services, and creates opportunities for those seeking to transition from conventional living to discover practical pathways forward. Our visible presence—including our buses with clear messaging—does much of the outreach work simply by existing in public spaces.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is where people learn that joining the Network isn't about escaping a lack of meaning, but about actively building the best possible vocation and living situation through voluntary cooperation.
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>Outer Realm: Operating in Hostile Territory</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					The Outer Realm is everywhere the state still holds dominant influence—cities, conventional workplaces, regulated spaces, and areas where living freely requires constant vigilance. When you're "behind enemy lines" with few other agorists around, you're operating in the Outer Realm.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is where most people start. You maintain a conventional job, pay rent in state-controlled housing, and interact primarily with people who don't understand or care about freedom from coercion. The Outer Realm is characterized by isolation—you're maintaining a bubble of freedom around yourself, but without strong support networks nearby.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>The goal isn't to stay in the Outer Realm</strong>—it's to use it strategically while building connections, skills, and resources that allow you to move deeper into Inter and Inner Realms. Many Network members maintain a presence in the Outer Realm for specific purposes (earning currency, maintaining family connections, conducting outreach), but they don't live there mentally or spiritually.
				</p>
				<p>
					Think of the Outer Realm as the starting zone. It's where you learn the basics, gather initial resources, and make your first connections. Then you progress inward as you build trust and capability.
				</p>

					<h2>Understanding Network Trust Levels</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					Beyond the geographic realms, the Network operates on progressive trust levels. These aren't rigid hierarchies—they're natural gradations of alignment and mutual confidence that develop through repeated interactions and demonstrated values.
				</p>

					<h3>The Six Levels of Network Engagement</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					These levels describe your relationship to the broader Network and help you understand who you can trust and cooperate with at different depths:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>Level 0: The Uninitiated</h4>
							<p>Individuals who don't value freedom sufficiently to allow others to peacefully coexist. They actively support or advocate for coercive systems. You may interact with Level 0 individuals for specific purposes, but they're not part of your trusted network.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Level 1: The Outer Network</h4>
							People who are willing to trade and interact
							with our network.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Level 2: Trusted Network</h4>
							People who respect the non-aggression
							principle, self-defense principle, and refrain
							from advocating for or taking direct action
							toward the destruction or restriction of your
							freedom to peacefully conduct yourself and
							your property as a physical extension of
							yourself in this world which you (the owner)
							alone possess authority over.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Level 3: Preferred Network</h4>
							Those from level 2 who also prioritize
							interactions with those who aim to make
							freedom more accessible to others. Bonus if
							they can understand a way towards freedom from
							coercion in this lifetime.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Level 4: The Subnet</h4>
							A subnet, or subnetwork, is a network within a
							network. Those who seek to grow (in
							â€œmagnitudeâ€) and strengthen the subnet.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Level 5: The Active-Subnet</h4>
							Includes those in your subnet with whom you
							interact and communicate with on a regular
							basis. This is the inner-most circle.
						</li>
					</ul>
