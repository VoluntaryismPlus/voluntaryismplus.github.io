				</div>
				<p>
					We have 5 vehicles and the mobile camping
					infrastructure setup available where we can share
					the infrastructure to support a loose, slow-moving
					caravan with the aim of ending slavery today
					through education, agorism and encouraging the
					connection between new and already made
					alternative networks.
				</p>
				<p>
					We aim to engage in agorist business and
					networking in the towns and cities we travel
					through. Presently, CaravAnarchy funds itself
					through donations and through multiple agorist
					business options we are equipped to employ. The
					aim is to create a marketplace every time we get
					to a new location, at which people in the nearby
					area can conduct their commerce in a safe and
					flourishing space.&nbsp;

						<p>
							Our
							<a href="chewsabout.html"
								>&ldquo;Ice Cream Philosophy&rdquo;</a
							>
							is that we strive to bring to market the
							finest quality Homemade Ice Cream products,
							sourcing ingredients from as many agorist
							sources as possible, sourcing only the highest
							quality ingredients.&nbsp; If you want access
							to the best Ice Cream this reality has to
							offer, you have to go through the agorist
							market.
						</p>
					</div>
					<br />
				</div>
				<br />
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>The Market Circuit</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					We are creating a perpetual free market that will
					provide a safe space for people to buy and sell
					agorist goods without fear of the government. We
					will travel from town to town, setting up in BLM
					land, staying for a month or more at a time, and
					from time to time venture to private campgrounds
					for freedom-respecting festivals.
				</p>
				<p>
					We don’t need to convince more people that this
					way of living is viable. There are already enough
					people who have seen the vision of how a free and
					voluntary society would work - if every one of
					them started living their life in this new way, we
					would make a big enough impact to gain the
					attention of the rest of the world. This is not
					another intentional community. This is a strategy
					towards creating freedom for all that can be
					adopted by every person immediately. There is no
					central location or leader that can be taken down.
					like an idea, it can only spread.
				</p>

					<h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					We are a traveling intentional agorist community
					whose objective is to create the best of all
					possible worlds. Some of our our strategies
					include:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">
						<ul>
							<li>
								Deploying agorist businesses outside of and
								adjacent to major cities
							</li>
							<li>
								Establishing gatherings and festivals
								focused on discussing our philosophy
							</li>
							<li>
								Engaging with all we meet in strategic
								lifestyle planning
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					We choose to be a caravan because we fulfill
					several specific needs amongst stationary
					communities:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">
						<ul>
							<li>
								The need to network with other communities,
								sharing information and resources
							</li>
							<li>
								The need to find a larger market in which to
								sell agorist goods and services
							</li>
							<li>
								The need for growth of the community through
								acquisition of vetted newcomers to the
								community
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Because of these needs, we are creating a caravan
					that will operate in perpetuity. Our functions
					might change and evolve, but there will always be
					a place for us in the ecosystem of the larger
					networks we are serving.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is not an isolated strategy. The ideal is for
					more caravans to take on this model and make it
					their own. We are publishing this information so
					that anyone can use this as a model to create
					their own caravan or community. We simply ask that
					you create a strategy that makes the whole world
					more free, not just your own little bubble of
					existence.
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>
						<strong>Our Bus, The Time Machine</strong>
					</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">
						<p>
							Those who have no bills are among the most
							wealthy of all, because they bask in an
							abundance of time.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					When we decided to leave the binds of the
					debt-based 9-5 lifestyle, we gained access to an
					invaluable resource: our time. Instead of using
					our life energy to support another person's dreams
					and deadlines, we are able to take back our
					autonomy and build the life that most fulfills and
					empowers us.
				</p>
				<p>
					With this newfound abundance, we are creating a
					healthy relationship to our time and helping
					others regain access to their time.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a concept that people who live in houses
					tend to have. This concept is that in order to
					establish roots in a community, one must settle
					down in a singular location where in time, they
					will make close friends and build or find
					community. This is one strategy, but is not
					necessarily the best strategy to make lasting
					bonds with others who share the same goals. For
					example, how often do your neighbors share your
					exact views? How often do people move to your town
					who share your goals? CaravAnarchy is a way of
					establishing a team of individuals who share the
					common objective of making the world more free for
					themselves wherever they are while maximizing
					freedom for the individual and growing one's
					network, team, or communities (yes, road life WILL
					expose you to multiple communities of people) by
					offering a superior alternative to the
					statist-quo.
				</p>
				<h4>Why We Are Nomads</h4>
				<p>
					Our choice to be travelers is not based off of a
					desire to be social. We are not searching for
					meaning or a soulmate. We have many direct reasons
					why we will choose to remain nomadic for the
					foreseeable future. Some of these reasons include
					the role we fill in society. Nomads provide a
					source of new information and make connections
					with people wherever they go.
				</p>
				<div class="image"><img src="img/van2.jpeg" /></div>
				<p>
					Nomads can be couriers of objects and goods. They
					can transport people from place to place,
					providing them lodging on the way there. Nomads
					can create events everywhere they go and collect
					unique items to share with others.
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3><strong>What we offer:</strong></h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Both
					<a href="2.2_NetworkHosts.html">network hosts</a>
					(accepting new members to be vetted for further
					network involvement) and
					<a href="welcomedesk.html">welcome outpost</a>,
					the caravan blends these capabilities while
					retaining wings focused on outreach, protection,
					and whatever other topics the current team cares
					about. Shelter/Housing can be brought or provided
					by the caravan in a win/win exchange.
				</p>
				<p>
					The caravan is the current primary creator of
					abundance loops within the network. But we are not
					the network in itself. We are network support. Our
					network is designed to protect ourselves and
					others by having backup networks in multiple
					states.
				</p>
				<p>
					We hold a marketplace everywhere we go. Festivals
					for up to a month duration anywhere we park. The
					properties we support are those who are structured
					on unanimous consent.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">

							<em
								>We go to a city. We set up a temporary camp
								on the outskirts of that city. We draw
								people in and give them tools to connect

					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h4>
						We are a machine designed to create the changes

					</h4>
				</div>
				<p>
					We are peddling voluntaryism, not labor. We do
					talks and discussions. And we have the vision to
					create the lore. We are the bards.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Workshop is a separate and complimentary
					gathering within the voluntarism outreach team
					that consists of people who teach certain skills
					and travel around or stay in one place offering
					information.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">
						<ul>
							<li>
								Outreach - go forth and form new voluntarist
								communities
							</li>
							<li>
								Information - Cultivate and make available
								voluntaryist information and art
							</li>
							<li>
								Culture - Create festivals, stories, and
								voluntaryist media. Seminars wherever we go,
								creating communities wherever we go.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					We offer a place for everyone to go and, if they
					see it necessary, for them to never return to
					their old lives. Whether they want to learn a
					trade in an Guild, start their own business, or
					just live free on land arbitrated by no ruler. The
					free land we have will build itself up with the
					hands of people who know their labor is going
					towards something that will support them in the
					future.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will meet up with people in different cities to
					start new festivals. We spend a month in an area
					at a time, where the caravan can recoup and secure
					gas money for the next destination. The main
					caravan will focus on a new location vs an older
					location but yearly festivals will persist and
					other caravans will go wherever they please.
				</p>
				<p>
					We retain a unique perspective based on our
					exposure to a diverse demographic of communities.
					We are historians and philosophers with a large
					sphere of influence. We do not need donations
					nearly as much as we need people on the ground.
					But donations will go towards a network that will
					provide for every one of us in the ways we want
					and need from our community.

				</div>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>Slow-Traveling Faire</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					We will go to an area for a month or more at a
					time and during that time we will focus on forming
					a group capable of continuing the Voluntary
					Welcome Hub and Freedom Hub full-time. We will
					also focus on setting up recurring meetups and a
					festival that can help bring people into the
					network. We will have a constant presence during
					that time. Shelter/Housing can be brought or
					provided by those in the area, if not found on BLM
					lands.
				</p>
				<p>
					You will wake up every day knowing where the
					central caravan location is. That location is
					somewhere where you can meet people, craft, and
					trade. Sometimes there is no main camp and the
					people in the caravan do outreach in the town
					because there is not a central meeting location
					possible. In this case, the caravan will be
					centered around a certain known friendly location.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this way, each vehicle in the caravan can be
					stationed in its most strategic location and the
					center of the caravan does not depend on the
					presence of any one vehicle at that location. That
					location becomes a welcome hub location and
					anarchists at that location can provide welcome
					hub services.

								>We have a system for saving people from the
								cities</em
							>
						</h4>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					At the time of this writing, we (CaravAnarchy)
					have a converted short-bus (skoolie), a 35 ft 5th
					wheel, a car, and an extended van with a bed built
					out.
				</p>
				<p>
					The idea is to help everyone who is having trouble
					redirecting their income stream and expenditures
					to purely agorist sources - so that we can keep
					the wealth in the family and grow a system that
					will stand resolute against all threats. Our
					caravan is growing - and with it sprouts new
					spaces for people who don&rsquo;t yet have a
					vehicle to sleep in of their own. Everywhere we
					go, we have a huge camp offering and tables set up
					inviting folks to learn about the opportunities
					available in this ever-growing agorist network.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, we invest the wealth we have, after
					taking care of our basic needs, into obtaining the
					infrastructure and tools necessary to sustain
					multiple agorist businesses on-the-go. For
					example, we can provide the tools necessary to run
					a pizzeria, burger bar, ice cream stand, bakery,
					pie-cobbler stand, and tools to help support other
					types of businesses. These businesses can be
					lucrative depending on the market conditions.
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>We have a solution for your lowest moment</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					We are here for you. Do you have a way to protect
					yourself? Need to get away or need another house?
					We&rsquo;ll provide the details you provide the
					specs - let's all be more sure about what we're
					gonna get.
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>Van Lifer? Become a Bounty Bringer!</h3>

					Bounties are like wanted ads. You can ask people
					for things they want and add them to the bounty
					board. You may then complete these bounties or
					pick up bounties that already exist on the board.

					<h2><strong>Caravan Positions</strong></h2>
				</div>
				<h4><em>Lifestyles for Freedom</em></h4>
				<p>
					There are different tiers of positions in the
					caravan. There are temporary travelers and there
					are full-time crew. You are welcome to create your
					ideal interaction. Every position is a win-win
					relationship. The basic position is a traveler.
					Travelers pay for their own gas and insurance on
					their own vehicle or a vehicle in the fleet they
					are renting. Rental vehicles also have a charge
					for paperwork and another for wear and tear. There
					will be many positions available.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you come on our caravan, you will get these
					great benefits:&nbsp;
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">

							<li>
								You will wake up every day knowing where the

								people, craft and trade, and more.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Rarely, there is no central location and the
					people in the caravan do outreach in the town. In
					this case, the caravan main camp will be centered
					around aknown friendly location.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3><strong>Bringing Everybody Along</strong></h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					You don&rsquo;t need to become a nomad -
					it&rsquo;s just highly suggested to take some time
					decompressing from the stressors of your life.
					This can be done either on the road or at a
					stationary location.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many needs are fulfilled by our caravan. The point
					is not only to have people coming along with us
					but to connect people with things they need. We
					can use our boon to share with others what we have
					in excess.
