				</p>
				<p>
					Your followers ask "What do I actually DO?" and you give them theory, principles, 
					philosophy. That's valuable—but it's not enough. They need concrete steps, real 
					infrastructure, working examples they can join or replicate.

					<h2>How to Start a Conversation</h2>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Step 1: Initial Contact</h3>
					<p>
						Email us at <a href="mailto:caravanarchy@proton.me">caravanarchy@proton.me</a> 
						with:
					</p>
					<ul style="color: #bbb; line-height: 1.8;">
						<li>Brief intro to who you are and what you do</li>
						<li>Your area of expertise or interest</li>
						<li>What type of collaboration you're considering</li>
						<li>What problem you're trying to solve (if applicable)</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Step 2: Exploratory Call</h3>
					<p>
						We'll set up a conversation to:
					</p>
					<ul style="color: #bbb; line-height: 1.8;">
						<li>Understand your goals and vision</li>
						<li>Explore alignment with our network</li>
						<li>Identify concrete collaboration opportunities</li>
						<li>Determine if this makes sense for both sides</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Step 3: Pilot Project</h3>
					<p>
						Start small with a defined project:
					</p>
					<ul style="color: #bbb; line-height: 1.8;">
						<li>One workshop at a festival, or</li>
						<li>One article/guide contribution, or</li>
						<li>One joint event or initiative</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This lets us work together before making bigger commitments.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Step 4: Ongoing Collaboration</h3>
					<p>
						If the pilot works, we explore deeper integration:
					</p>
					<ul style="color: #bbb; line-height: 1.8;">
						<li>Regular speaking engagements</li>
						<li>Guild leadership or advisory role</li>
						<li>Strategic partnership development</li>
						<li>Co-creation of new initiatives</li>

					<h3 style="color: #ff6b6b;">We're Not Looking for Influencers</h3>
					<p>
						If your main value is a large following but no practical expertise, this 
						probably isn't the right fit. We need people who can teach, build, and 
						implement—not just broadcast.
					</p>

				<div class="callout" style="background-color: rgba(60, 1, 1, 0.3); border-left: 4px solid #ff6b6b;">
					<h3 style="color: #ff6b6b;">We're Not Looking for Control</h3>
					<p>
						If you want to lead the whole network or have everyone adopt your specific 
						vision, that won't work. We're building a decentralized ecosystem where many 
						visions can coexist and cross-pollinate.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout" style="background-color: rgba(60, 1, 1, 0.3); border-left: 4px solid #ff6b6b;">
					<h3 style="color: #ff6b6b;">We're Not Looking for Pure Theory</h3>
					<p>
						If you can't connect your ideas to practical implementation, they won't be 
						useful here. We respect theory, but we need frameworks that work in the real 
						world with real people.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout" style="background-color: rgba(60, 1, 1, 0.3); border-left: 4px solid #ff6b6b;">
					<h3 style="color: #ff6b6b;">We're Not Looking for Compromise</h3>
					<p>
						If your approach requires working with the state, seeking political solutions, 
						or compromising on voluntary principles, we're not aligned. This is explicitly 
						an agorist network.
