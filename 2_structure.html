          The Agorist Network is designed for clarity,
          security, and progressive engagement.
          Understanding its structure and the different
          ways you can interact is key to navigating your
          journey within it.

        <h2>The Welcome Desk</h2>
        <p>
          The Welcome Desk serves as your initial point of
          contact for anyone eager to learn more about our
          network and the pathways to a new life within it.
          For detailed information on getting started and
          connecting with network hosts, visit our dedicated
          <a href="2_welcomedesk.html">Welcome Desk page</a>.

        <h2>Understanding the Realms</h2>
        <p>
          Our network operates across distinct "realms,"
          each with unique characteristics and levels of
          engagement designed to protect our principles and
          foster growth:
        </p>
        <div class="imagenoborder">
          <img src="img/Realms.png" alt="Network Realms Diagram" />
        </div>
        <h3>Inner Realm:</h3>
        <p>
          The fundamental rule here is no rulers and
          absolute adherence to the Non-Aggression Principle
          (NAP). This space is free from coercion. We
          protect certain private spaces for those who have
          expressed a clear understanding of our network's
          principles and the NAP. While risks are a part of
          life, we aim to safeguard what's essential.<br />
          Entrance to the network's Inner Realm is managed
          through Admissions. You can establish yourself as
          a trusted member by connecting with a Network
          Host, joining a caravan, or studying materials in
          The Library to gain the necessary knowledge. Feel
          free to apply at any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Inter Realm:</h3>
        <p>
          Wherever a caravan travels becomes the Inter
          Realm. Our buses, adorned with clear signage,
          often do much of our activism, making our presence
          known in outer city outposts and other locations.
          This realm is designed to help people transition
          and understand that living here isn't an escape
          from a lack of meaning, but a deliberate path
          towards finding one's best possible vocation and
          living situation.
        </p>
        <h3>Outer Realm:</h3>
        <p>
          The Outer Realm is where we engage in outreach.
          This is the space you occupy when you're "behind
          enemy lines," operating in areas where agorists
          are few, and maintaining even a bubble of freedom
          requires constant vigilance.

            <li>
              <strong>Level 2: Trusted Network</strong
              ><br />
              Those who respect the Non-Aggression Principle
              (NAP), the self-defense principle, and refrain
              from advocating for or taking direct action
              toward the destruction or restriction of your
              freedom to peacefully conduct yourself and
              your property as a physical extension of
              yourself, over which you (the owner) alone

              Those from Level 2 who also prioritize
              interactions with individuals aiming to make
              freedom more accessible to others. It's a
              bonus if they can articulate a path towards
              freedom from coercion in this lifetime.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Level 4: The Subnet</strong><br />
              A subnetwork within the larger network,
              comprising those who actively seek to grow and
              strengthen the subnet.

              Includes those in your subnet with whom you

          Your &ldquo;Network&rdquo; is a physical
          manifestation of your interactions. Interactions
          with intention can result in networks with
          intention, and the clusters and groups of
          individuals that result therefrom.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Your network already exists. Now, identify your
          trusted &ldquo;subnet&rdquo;, or network of
          individuals you have established trust with, who
          share your intention and objective of creating a
          more free world for themselves and others, and
          whom you have established sufficient moral and/or
          ethical common ground with. If they are a
          potential threat to you or yours, confront them
          about it and establish healthy boundaries with
          them. If they do not respect your boundaries, do
          not consider them a part of your trusted subnet.

          Essentially, we are advocating individuals
          establish decentralized (enclaves), both localized
          and dispersed, aimed at making freedom more
          accessible for others. This guide will go into
          detail about how networks will solve the issue of
          scaling up from small communities to places that
          have larger populations.&nbsp;

          The moral philosophy of voluntaryism is not
          required to posit a working solution for how the
          world would look without a government as that will
          be created organically by those involved. Still,
          there are many resources on times past and present
          where anarchy has existed or exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of a society functioning without a
          centralized, coercive state might seem radical in
          today's world, but history offers numerous
          compelling examples. For millennia, human
          communities have successfully organized
          themselves, resolved disputes, and thrived through
          voluntary association, decentralized governance,
          and customary law, proving that sophisticated
          social order doesn't require a monopolistic
          authority.

        <p>
          One of the most practical ways to reduce reliance on
          state police is through coordinated community response.
          When disputes or incidents occur, showing up as a group
          of trusted neighbors creates accountability and often
          de-escalates situations more effectively than armed
          authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can take many forms: informal neighborhood watch
          networks, rapid response communication channels, or
          simply the understanding that your subnet members will
          support each other when needed. The presence of multiple
          witnesses and mediators often prevents conflicts from
          escalating, while the absence of state involvement keeps
          situations from turning into criminal matters with
          life-altering consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start small: establish communication with 3-5 nearby
          network members or trusted neighbors who share your
          values. Create a simple way to reach each other quickly.
          Practice showing up for each other in non-emergency
          situations firstâ€”helping with projects, resolving minor
          disputes, building trust. This foundation makes
          coordinated response natural when it matters most.

          <h2>Putting Structure Into Practice</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Understanding the Network's structure is just the beginning. The real value comes from actively engaging with it—building your subnet, progressing through trust levels, and contributing to the strength of both Inner and Inter Realms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that these structures exist to serve freedom, not restrict it. They're tools for building trust, protecting what matters, and scaling voluntary cooperation from small groups to large networks. Your participation shapes how these structures evolve.
