          The Agorist Network is designed for clarity,
          security, and progressive engagement.
          Understanding it's structure and the different

        <h2>The Welcome Desk</h2>
        <p>
          The Welcome Desk serves as your initial point of
          contact for anyone eager to learn more about our
          network and the pathways to a new life within it.
          Whether you're looking for general information or

          While we're a nomadic community, we strive to
          provide accessible support. We facilitate
          connections for in-person support and operate
          communication channels to assist newcomers. To get

        <h2>Understanding the Realm</h2>
        <p>
          Our network operates across distinct "realms,"
          each with unique characteristics and levels of
          engagement designed to protect our principles and
          foster growth:
        </p>
        <a href="realms.html"
          ><div class="imagenoborder">
            <img src="img/Realms.png" />
          </div>
        </a>
        <h3>Inner Realm:</h3>
        <p>
          The fundamental rule here is no rulers and
          absolute adherence to the Non-Aggression Principle
          (NAP). This space is free from coercion. We
          protect certain private spaces for those who have
          expressed a clear understanding of our network's
          principles and the NAP. While risks are a part of
          life, we aim to safeguard what's essential.<br />
          Entrance to the network's Inner Realm is managed
          through Admissions. You can establish yourself as
          a trusted member by connecting with a Network
          Host, joining a caravan, or studying materials in
          The Library to gain the necessary knowledge. Feel
          free to apply at any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Inter Realm:</h3>
        <p>
          Wherever a caravan travels becomes the Inter
          Realm. Our buses, adorned with clear signage,
          often do much of our activism, making our presence
          known in outer city outposts and other locations.
          This realm is designed to help people transition
          and understand that living here isn't an escape
          from a lack of meaning, but a deliberate path
          towards finding one's best possible vocation and
          living situation.
        </p>
        <h3>Outer Realm:</h3>
        <p>
          The Outer Realm is where we engage in outreach.
          This is the space you occupy when you're "behind
          enemy lines," operating in areas where agorists
          are few, and maintaining even a bubble of freedom
          requires constant vigilance.

            <li>
              <strong>Level 2: Trusted Network</strong

              Those who respect the Non-Aggression Principle
              (NAP), the self-defense principle, and refrain
              from advocating for or taking direct action
              toward the destruction or restriction of your
              freedom to peacefully conduct yourself and
              your property as a physical extension of

              Those from Level 2 who also prioritize
              interactions with individuals aiming to make
              freedom more accessible to others. It's a
              bonus if they can articulate a path towards
              freedom from coercion in this lifetime.

            <li>
              <strong>Level 4: The Subnet</strong><br />
              A subnetwork within the larger network,
              comprising those who actively seek to grow and
              strengthen the subnet.

          Your &ldquo;Network&rdquo; is a physical
          manifestation of your interactions. Interactions
          with intention can result in networks with
          intention, and the clusters and groups of
          individuals that result therefrom.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Your network already exists. Now, identify your
          trusted &ldquo;subnet&rdquo;, or network of
          individuals you have established trust with, who
          share your intention and objective of creating a
          more free world for themselves and others, and
          whom you have established sufficient moral and/or
          ethical common ground with. If they are a
          potential threat to you or yours, confront them
          about it and establish healthy boundaries with
          them. If they do not respect your boundaries, do
          not consider them a part of your trusted subnet.

          Essentially, we are advocating individuals
          establish decentralized (enclaves), both localized
          and dispersed, aimed at making freedom more
          accessible for others. This guide will go into
          detail about how networks will solve the issue of
          scaling up from small communities to places that
          have larger populations.&nbsp;

          The moral philosophy of voluntaryism is not
          required to posit a working solution for how the
          world would look without a government as that will
          be created organically by those involved. Still,
          there are many resources on times past and present
          where anarchy has existed or exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of a society functioning without a
          centralized, coercive state might seem radical in
          today's world, but history offers numerous
          compelling examples. For millennia, human
          communities have successfully organized
          themselves, resolved disputes, and thrived through
          voluntary association, decentralized governance,
          and customary law, proving that sophisticated
          social order doesn't require a monopolistic
          authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the Icelandic Commonwealth, which
          flourished for over four centuries (930 C.E. -
          1262 C.E.) without a centralized executive
          authority or a standing army. Power was
          distributed among chieftains whose influence came
          from the voluntary allegiance of their followers,
          not from coercive state power. Its national
          assembly, the Althing, debated laws and resolved
          disputes, yet lacked any executive power to
          enforce its rulings. Enforcement relied primarily
          on private legal action, arbitration, and the
          social pressure of the community. This period in
          Icelandic history stands as a testament to
          maintaining complex social order through
          decentralized governance and voluntary
          association.

          In order to replace some of the reliance on
          government police, try coordinating with your
          friends and neighbors so you show up as a group to
          the scene of a dispute or incident.
