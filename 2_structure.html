      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <p>
          The Agorist Network is designed for clarity,
          security, and progressive engagement.
          Understanding its structure and the different ways
          you can interact is key to navigating your journey
          within it.
        </p>

        <h2>The Welcome Desk</h2>
        <p>
          The Welcome Desk serves as your initial point of
          contact for anyone eager to learn more about our
          network and the pathways to a new life within it.
          For detailed information on getting started and
          connecting with network hosts, visit our dedicated
          <a href="2_welcomedesk.html">Welcome Desk page</a
          >.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>The Three Circles of the Network</h2>
        <p>
          Our network operates across three distinct
          circles, each representing different levels of
          trust, engagement, and access. Think of these as
          concentric circles—not a hierarchy, but layers of
          relationship depth. Everyone starts at the
          Perimeter, and movement inward happens through
          demonstrated alignment with our principles and
          building trust over time.
        </p>

            src="img/Realms.png"
            alt="Network Circles Diagram" />
        </div>

        <h3>The Core</h3>
        <p>
          The Core represents the deepest level of network
          engagement—trusted members who have demonstrated
          clear understanding and consistent practice of
          voluntaryist principles and the Non-Aggression
          Principle (NAP). This is where private spaces,
          sensitive information, and the most intimate
          collaborations exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What defines Core members:</strong>
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Demonstrated commitment to NAP and voluntary
              principles
            </li>
            <li>
              Proven track record of honoring agreements and
              respecting boundaries
            </li>
            <li>
              Vetted through the Admissions process or
              strong network references
            </li>
            <li>
              Active participation in building network
              infrastructure
            </li>
            <li>
              Trusted with access to private communications
              and locations
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>How to reach the Core:</strong> Connect
          with a Network Host, join a caravan, participate
          actively in network activities, or study materials
          in The Library to demonstrate understanding. Apply
          for admission when you're ready—there's no fixed
          timeline. Trust is earned through consistent
          behavior, not time served.
        </p>

        <h3>The Frontier</h3>
        <p>
          The Frontier is the active transition zone—where
          people move from curiosity to commitment, from
          observer to participant. This is where most of our
          visible activity happens: caravans traveling
          between locations, festivals and gatherings,
          public outreach, and initial vetting of new
          members.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What happens in the Frontier:</strong>
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Caravans establish temporary hubs and
              marketplaces
            </li>
            <li>
              Festivals and events introduce people to
              network culture
            </li>
            <li>
              New members learn practical skills and
              philosophy
            </li>
            <li>
              Trust-building happens through shared
              activities
            </li>
            <li>
              Mentorship and education in voluntaryist
              principles
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Frontier isn't a waiting room—it's an active
          space where people discover whether this life
          aligns with their values. Our buses and visible
          presence serve as access points, clearly marked to
          signal where the parallel economy operates. This
          is where people transition from wondering "could I
          live like this?" to actively building that life.
        </p>

        <h3>The Perimeter</h3>
        <p>
          The Perimeter is where we engage with the broader
          world—the interface between the network and
          everyone outside it. This includes public
          outreach, educational content, initial contact
          with curious individuals, and operations in areas
          where building freedom requires constant vigilance
          against state interference.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Perimeter activities include:</strong>
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Public-facing educational content and
              philosophy
            </li>
            <li>
              Initial contact points for interested
              individuals
            </li>
            <li>
              Trading with non-network members who respect
              voluntary exchange
            </li>
            <li>
              Outreach at events, online spaces, and through
              media
            </li>
            <li>
              Operating "behind enemy lines" where agorists
              are rare
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Perimeter is essential—it's how we grow, how
          we spread ideas, and how we connect with people
          ready for alternatives. But it's also where the
          most caution is necessary, as not everyone here
          shares our values or understands voluntary
          principles.
        </p>

          Your journey within our network can deepen through

            <li>
              <h4>Level 0: The Uninitiated</h4>
              Individuals who do not value freedom
              sufficiently to allow others to peacefully
              coexist.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Level 1: The Outer Network</h4>
              People who are willing to trade and interact
              with our network.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Level 2: Trusted Network</h4>
              Those who respect the Non-Aggression Principle
              (NAP), the self-defense principle, and refrain
              from advocating for or taking direct action
              toward the destruction or restriction of your
              freedom to peacefully conduct yourself and
              your property as a physical extension of
              yourself, over which you (the owner) alone
              possess authority.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Level 3: Preferred Network</h4>
              Those from Level 2 who also prioritize
              interactions with individuals aiming to make
              freedom more accessible to others. It's a
              bonus if they can articulate a path towards
              freedom from coercion in this lifetime.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Level 4: The Subnet</h4>
              A subnetwork within the larger network,
              comprising those who actively seek to grow and
              strengthen the subnet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Level 5: The Active-Subnet</h4>
              Includes those in your subnet with whom you
              interact and communicate with on a regular
              basis. This represents the innermost circle of
              consistent engagement.

          Your "Network" is a physical manifestation of your
          interactions. Interactions with intention can
          result in networks with intention, and the
          clusters and groups of individuals that result
          therefrom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your network already exists. Now, identify your
          trusted "subnet", or network of individuals you
          have established trust with, who share your
          intention and objective of creating a more free
          world for themselves and others, and whom you have
          established sufficient moral and/or ethical common
          ground with. If they are a potential threat to you
          or yours, confront them about it and establish
          healthy boundaries with them. If they do not
          respect your boundaries, do not consider them a
          part of your trusted subnet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Essentially, we are advocating individuals
          establish decentralized enclaves, both localized
          and dispersed, aimed at making freedom more
          accessible for others. This guide will go into
          detail about how networks will solve the issue of
          scaling up from small communities to places that
          have larger populations.

          The moral philosophy of voluntaryism is not
          required to posit a working solution for how the
          world would look without a government as that will
          be created organically by those involved. Still,
          there are many resources on times past and present
          where anarchy has existed or exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of a society functioning without a
          centralized, coercive state might seem radical in
          today's world, but history offers numerous
          compelling examples. For millennia, human
          communities have successfully organized
          themselves, resolved disputes, and thrived through
          voluntary association, decentralized governance,
          and customary law, proving that sophisticated
          social order doesn't require a monopolistic
          authority.

        <p>
          One of the most practical ways to reduce reliance
          on state police is through coordinated community
          response. When disputes or incidents occur,
          showing up as a group of trusted neighbors creates
          accountability and often de-escalates situations
          more effectively than armed authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can take many forms: informal neighborhood
          watch networks, rapid response communication
          channels, or simply the understanding that your
          subnet members will support each other when
          needed. The presence of multiple witnesses and
          mediators often prevents conflicts from
          escalating, while the absence of state involvement
          keeps situations from turning into criminal
          matters with life-altering consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start small: establish communication with 3-5
          nearby network members or trusted neighbors who
          share your values. Create a simple way to reach
          each other quickly. Practice showing up for each
          other in non-emergency situations first—helping
          with projects, resolving minor disputes, building
          trust. This foundation makes coordinated response
          natural when it matters most.

        <p>
          Understanding the Network's structure is just the
          beginning. The real value comes from actively
          engaging with it—building your subnet, progressing
          through trust levels, and contributing to the
          strength of the Core, Frontier, and Perimeter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that these circles exist to serve
          freedom, not restrict it. They're tools for
          building trust, protecting what matters, and
          scaling voluntary cooperation from small groups to
          large networks. Your participation shapes how
          these structures evolve.
