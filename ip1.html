        <h2>Step One: Becoming Prepared</h2>
        <p>
          There are several steps that we insist any person
          should undertake if they are interested in joining
          a partnership that will last forever.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Are You Ready?</h4>

        <p>
          Everyone deserves love. But if you’re not prepared
          to be in a relationship, you shouldn’t be in one.
          Luckily, you can prepare yourself. Becoming
          prepared for a lasting relationship is not some
          far away goal that will only come from years of
          meditation, practice and study.
        </p>
        <p>
          This first step can be used as a personal check-in
          about your forever relationship readiness.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Forever? Really?</h4>
        <p>
          If you are worried about the term "forever", you
          might have never found someone who you felt deserved to be
          loved forever. Why would we say 'deserved'? We use
          the term 'deserving' to denote someone who is
          prepared to be responsible for themselves in
          relationship. This means they will not be in a
          relationship that they do not see as 'forever'
          material. This means that they know what they want
          and do not hold beliefs that are toxic to
          relationships.

            How to Become Deserving of a Life Partner:
          </h5>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Be a person who could love someone for life
              - Examine judgments -
              Do you think you are above all others?
              - Going too far with beliefs
              - If you are going to judge, make
              sure they have the same dogmatism for life
            </li>
            <li>
              Be aware of and communicate your
              non-negotiables

        <p>
          There are some traits we have identified as
          marking someone as being prepared for a
          relationship. Here are some of these:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <h5>Non-Negotiable Traits:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Openness</li>
            <li>Communication</li>
            <li>Self-awareness</li>
            <li>Interest in your partner</li>
            <li>
              Open minded about all of your partner’s
              interests and habits (You can still want them
              to change)
            </li>
            <li>
              Responsibilities around you and your partner's
              needs
            </li>
            <li>You can work with them</li>
            <li>
              They should know their needs, but you can help
              them discover them
            </li>
            <li>
              Interest in helping them know themselves more
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
          I will use the terms “good” and “bad” here. My
          reasoning is that most good and bad is subjective,
          and something that you have to assess for
          yourself. What would be a healthy direction for
          you to go towards? That is your good. Not moving
          towards anything personally healthy is your bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, since you can learn from any action or
          decision, I would assert that no actions or
          decisions are bad in themselves, and that it would
          only be a move in a “bad” direction to not learn
          from the results in a way that supports your
          “good” path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even more controversially, I would say that there
          are some things that
          <em>are</em>
          objectively good or bad. I would argue that
          conducting voluntary interactions with others is
          good, and force or coercion is bad. Change through
          learning is good, and stagnation is bad. Searching
          for the truth to a situation is good, and
          self-deception or willful ignorance is bad. Having
          a toxic and powerless relationship with a family
          member, substance or habit is bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that most inherently bad things involve a
          person first being aware that they are making
          these bad decisions. They need to be aware that
          there is another option. If you make these bad
          decisions continuously even when made aware of
          them, you are most likely not going to be good for
          someone in a relationship.

        <h3>Know Your Patterns</h3>
        <p>
          In order to plan for how to maintain a respectful
          relationship, you must set it up for the most
          success possible. Think of solutions to your most
          common pitfalls in relationships and in life.
          Having someone who cares about you in your life
          could create an opening for new ways of addressing
          issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not define these patterns as weaknesses, but
          instead as patterns which are strategies based on
          needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          However you address your patterns, this is a
          crucial step in being present for a bond that is
          designed not to fail.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Depression</h5>
        <p>
          If you are often depressed or anxious, make sure
          to involve your partner as a positive force in
          those situations. Do not set yourself up for
          failure by ignoring the possibility that you might
          become depressed regardless of whether your
          partner is fulfilling their agreement with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, tell your partner about the things that
          trigger your depression and make sure they are
          willing to help support you to address the
          situations that trigger these feelings. Consider
          that your depression might be situational, and
          that it might be trying to tell you something
          about a deep desire you have, or a deep fear you
          have not adressed. Allow your partner to be on the
          same team as you as you work on your life to right
          this wrong.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Infidelity</h5>
        <p>
          If you are tempted to look for others outside of
          your relationship, have compassion for that part
          of yourself and discover what it is that you are
          really looking for when you do this. Are you
          looking for excitement? If so, how can you make
          sure your relationship will excite you?
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you might have a world-view that
          creates these problems. Do you believe that love
          is a feeling that fades naturally over time? Do
          you believe that if someone got close to you, they
          would never love you fully? Perhaps that you are
          inherently a bad person? Or do you believe that no
          one deserves enduring, faithful love? You should
          realize that any of these beliefs are false and
          that you should never enter a relationship while
          holding any of them as true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you want more from a partner than you feel
          comfortable asking for? Perhaps you aren't
          fulfilled by a partner because they do not give
          you the love in the way you desire and deserve. To
          learn more about how to ask for the love you
          desire, see <a href="ip4.html">Step Four.</a>
        </p>
        
        <h5>Boredom</h5>
        <p>
          It is not your partner's responsibility to
          entertain you, but you need to choose a person who
          has a lifestyle that excites you. Even if you are
          excited by being a homebody, there will always be
          certain activities that make you fulfilled and
          happy. You need to identify these before entering
          a relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          The need for entertainment can stem from a life
          lacking in meaning. Your daily life should be
          designed to fulfil you such that excitement comes
          from achieving real things that make your life
          better. If you are dealing with a life you just
          want to cope with, that is an overarching problem
          that will cause all kinds of dysfunction in your
          life.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>
          It's not true that all relationships lose their
          excitement over time. It is true that they may
          begin to devolve if one partner has expectations
          that the other partner does not reciprocate. That
          is why communication before entering a
          relationship is imperative. Talk about what you
          want your relationship to look like in five years.
          Make sure your partner wants something similar.
          But also make sure they are capable of this and
          that they know their own weaknesses as well as you
          do.
