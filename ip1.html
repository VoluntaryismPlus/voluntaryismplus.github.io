        <h3>Step One: The Initial Agreement</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          We built this framework based on the positive
          results of the experiment of our relationship.
          Before we started our relationship, I took three
          months to align myself correctly and formulate a
          contract that I saw no way that I could break.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was borne of a lifetime of looking outside of
          my romantic relationships for fulfillment and
          understanding. I took this time and created this
          contract because I needed to know that I could
          promise I would not falter because of what I found
          lacking in our relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          I figured out an agreement that I could commit to,
          but it required my partner to also be open to
          changing himself, his habits, and his worldview,
          especially if I had a problem that needed to be
          addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did not eliminate the possibility of a breakup,
          but I lessened it dramatically by addressing all
          of my most common pitfalls. Importantly, I put the
          survival of our relationship into both of our
          hands, ensuring that if my partner was willing to
          do what was needed to make it survive, I was
          willing to do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          This agreement is based on my own personal
          weaknesses. Therefore, another person's agreement
          might have a few unique clauses to this one. My
          agreement can either be used as a guide or you are
          welcome to use it verbatim.

          <h3>The Initial Agreement</h3>
          <p>
            Before I enter a relationship with you, I will
            make sure that the following is true for me.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              I do not believe that love is a feeling that
              can go away, but a choice. I take
              responsibility for the healthy interpretation
              and resolution of any feelings I have as long
              as you are also willing to work with me on the
              root causes and results of these feelings.
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              I am willing to make changes to my way of
              doing things, or to myself, in order to be a
              better partner for you.
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              I promise that if anything comes up that
              threatens our relationship, like:<br />- I am
              changing <br />- I am discovering new things
              about myself <br />- I am discovering more
              about you <br />- I have met someone who I
              like <br />- I am commiserating with others
              <br /><br />
              I will tell you as soon as I realize it,
              before I make any new conclusions that bring
              us farther apart, and I will give you the
              opportunity to be involved in any conclusions
              I make.
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              I have a method by which any problems can be
              addressed, and I do not believe these
              experiences have power over us but that we
              have the power to use them to make us
              stronger.

          We will provide our method to address these
