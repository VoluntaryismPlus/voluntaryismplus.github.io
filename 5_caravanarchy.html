			<h1>Caravanarchy</h1>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>A Nomadic Agorist Community Model</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Current Location:</strong> We are
					currently camped out in Baca Canyon located near
					Heber, AZ for CaravAnarchy Sun Campout, followed
					by Jackfest, and lastly Sacred Bass. All three of
					these events take place in the same location.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are a traveling intentional agorist community
					dedicated to creating the best of all possible
					worlds by living freedom today. Our model combines
					the principles of agorism with a nomadic lifestyle
					to foster a decentralized and resilient network of
					liberty.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							Deploying agorist businesses in and around
							major cities, making the parallel economy
							accessible to more people.
						</li>
						<li>
							Establishing gatherings and festivals that
							focus on discussing our philosophy, fostering
							connection, and providing hands-on education.
						</li>
						<li>
							Engaging with everyone we meet in strategic
							lifestyle planning, empowering individuals to
							reclaim their time and autonomy.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
					We believe in real solutions, right now. We are
					creating options for freedom, and we invite you to
					explore how you can create one too.
					<strong>The True Realm is HERE!</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Join the Caravan of Freedom: Your Guide to a Life
					Unbound.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>What We Are, Practically Speaking</h2>
				<p>
					For those seeking a tangible understanding,
					Caravanarchy is a
					<strong
						>fully nomadic community currently traveling in
						a converted bus and other vehicles.</strong
					>
					We operate with a large, adaptable
					<strong>camp setup</strong>, equipped with the
					tools and resources to support multiple
					individuals, even if you don't yet have your own
					nomadic vehicle. In fact, we maintain
					<strong>several vehicles in storage</strong> that
					can be utilized by those interested in trying out
					caravan life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our time is divided between two primary
					activities:
					<strong
						>actively engaging at free festivals</strong
					>, where we share our philosophy and peddle our
					wares, and
					<strong
						>detoxing on free-to-use public lands</strong
					>
					where we remotely develop our growing network. We
					typically spend
					<strong>a month or more in each location</strong>,
					allowing ample time for genuine friendships to
					develop with both fellow caravaneers and
					stationary individuals in the area.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>The Power of Networked Freedom</h2>
				<p>
					In a world that often seeks to control individual
					autonomy, networking emerges as a cornerstone of
					freedom and resilience. For the nomadic individual
					and the thriving agorist movement, cultivating
					robust social and economic connections across
					diverse locations is paramount. It's through these
					vital networks that individuals can establish
					reliable lines of support, maintain essential
					supplies, and facilitate win-win trade
					relationships, collectively building a formidable
					shield against external threats.
				</p>
				<p>
					Networking extends beyond personal security; it's
					the very lifeblood of the parallel economy. It
					enables the creation of "abundance loops," ensures
					the free flow of information, and allows for the
					organic expansion of agorist principles into new
					communities. By intentionally forging and
					nurturing these connections, we empower ourselves
					and others to live truly self-directed,
					interconnected lives, proving that a
					decentralized, voluntary society is not just an
					ideal, but a living reality.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Why We Are Nomads</h2>
				<p>
					Our choice to live a nomadic life is a strategic
					one, driven by key objectives beyond simple social
					connection or personal search for meaning. We fill
					specific, vital needs within the broader ecosystem
					of stationary communities and the growing Network
					of freedom.
				</p>
				<h3>Strategic Advantages of Nomadic Living:</h3>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Expanded Network & Resources:</strong>
							We actively connect with diverse communities,
							facilitating the exchange of information and
							resources, strengthening bonds across the
							broader agorist movement.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Market Expansion:</strong> Our travels
							allow us to find and create new markets for
							agorist goods and services, helping to fund
							the parallel economy and support
							freedom-oriented producers and consumers.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Community Growth:</strong> We foster
							organic, decentralized growth by introducing
							newcomers to actionable freedom and helping
							vet them for integration into the wider
							network.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Reclaiming Time:</strong> For us,
							nomadic life is a vocation for van-lifers, a
							path to reclaiming invaluable time from the
							debt-based 9-to-5 grind. By reducing fixed
							overheads, we gain immense autonomy over our
							time, enabling us to build lives that truly
							fulfill and empower us. This abundance of time
							allows us to help others regain their own.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Challenging the "Settled" Myth:</strong
							>
							The notion that deep community can only be
							built by "settling down" is an illusion.
							Caravanarchy demonstrates a superior
							alternative, establishing lasting bonds with
							those who share core objectives, fostering a
							broader, more resilient network. Road life
							inherently exposes us to multiple communities,
							fostering a broader network.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Information & Courier Services:</strong
							>
							Nomads serve as conduits for new information,
							couriers of goods, and facilitators of events,
							collecting and sharing unique items and
							experiences wherever we go.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<h3>Our Unique Role as Nomads:</h3>
				<p>
					In contrast to the stationary path, Caravanarchy
					is an intentional caravan with no plans of
					settling at one specific property or community
					space. While many we meet are interested in
					building stationary, self-sufficient communities
					(an important endeavor!), we are messengers
					helping to free people's minds and spreading the
					information needed to break free of the slave
					system.
				</p>
				<p>
					We see a specific need for a traveling community
					to purchase and distribute goods, and to raise
					awareness in each community we encounter of the
					agorist goods and services available throughout
					the network, while offering some of our own. We
					are committed to developing the infrastructure to
					support stationary farmers and artisans to sell
					their goods far beyond their local area. We will
					be like the semi-trucks who distribute goods
					across the land. This significantly reduces the
					effort for producers to sell their goods, as the
					cost of gas and vehicle maintenance for driving
					hours to market every week is absorbed by the
					business we have scheduled on our path.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is not another intentional community. This is
					a strategy towards creating freedom for all that
					can be adopted by every person immediately. There
					is no central location or leader that can be taken
					down. Like an idea, it can only spread. This is
					not an isolated strategy. We are publishing our
					information so that anyone can use this as a model
					to create their own caravan or community. We
					simply ask that you create a strategy that makes
					the whole world more free, not just your own
					bubble of existence. Our caravan is designed to
					operate in perpetuity, constantly evolving to
					serve the larger networks we support.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Life in the Caravan</h2>
				<p>
					Life in Caravanarchy is a dynamic experience
					centered around autonomy, collaboration, and
					continuous outreach.
				</p>
				<h3>The Adaptable Caravan & Base Camps:</h3>
				<p>
					The Caravan embodies a flexible approach, adapting
					its form daily to suit the occasion and atmosphere
					of each new location. The unique layouts of
					different regions across the continent create
					distinct opportunities for Hub locations to serve
					as temporary base camps. Each base camp is
					established for approximately a month, allowing
					the caravan to effectively conduct its work within
					the surrounding area.
				</p>
				<p>
					This caravan consists of individuals who choose to
					engage in mutually beneficial, win-win
					interactions with the Hub. Every member
					understands they can create their own caravan at
					any time, emphasizing personal autonomy within the
					collective. Each individual pursues their own
					unique, self-led path, which always aims for a
					win-win outcome. For example, some members focus
					on voluntaryist missionary work while
					simultaneously hosting a full-time festival and
					marketplace, enabling people to connect with the
					broader network.
				</p>
				<h3>Our Fleet:</h3>
				<p>
					Currently, our fleet includes a converted
					short-bus (skoolie), a 35 ft 5th wheel, a car, and
					an extended van with a bed. These vehicles serve
					as homes, mobile business hubs, and community
					spaces. We are continually investing in
					infrastructure and tools, and are planning future
					specialized vehicles like a Water Bus (washing
					machine, shower, sauna, plants), Electro-Bus
					(charging stations, wifi, sound system,
					entertainment, appliances), Demo Bus (construction
					tools, storage), Art Bus (woodworking, wire
					wrapping), Music Bus (recording studio, writing),
					Skill Delivery Bus (rides for skilled
					voluntaryists), Rideshare Bus, Tarot Bus, and
					Healing Bus (sound healing, massage, astrology).
				</p>
				<h3>Daily Rhythm:</h3>
				<p>
					You'll always know the central caravan location, a
					hub where you can meet people, engage in crafts,
					and trade. While individual vehicles can be parked
					strategically nearby or far, the core of the
					caravan maintains a consistent central meeting
					point. In areas where a main camp isn't feasible,
					we'll center around a known friendly location
					within the town. A separate silent area is
					designated for quiet campers.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>The Nightly Production:</strong> These
							are vibrant gatherings featuring performers,
							merchants, craftspeople, problem-solvers, and
							food/cafe operators.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>The Daily Offerings:</strong> Daytime
							activities include opportunities for writers,
							bounty fillers, and mechanics to contribute
							and engage.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<h3>Core Principles Guiding Our Interactions:</h3>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							All interactions and exchanges are net
							positive (win/win).
						</li>
						<li>
							Everyone agrees to the Non-Aggression
							Principle (NAP).
						</li>
						<li>
							For all, we support movement throughout Guilds
							to find their true passion.
						</li>
						<li>
							Emphasis on Self-Reliance while fostering
							interdependence.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>A Day in The Life: Caravaneer</h2>
				<p>
					<em
						>(Placeholder: This section will provide a
						detailed, immersive narrative of a typical day
						living and working within Caravanarchy. It will
						bring the descriptions of daily rhythm, roles,
						and community interaction to life through a
						compelling story.)</em
					>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Our Marketplace & Offerings</h2>
				<p>
					We establish perpetual free markets wherever we
					go, providing safe spaces for people to buy and
					sell agorist goods without fear of state
					intervention. We typically set up camp on public
					lands (like BLM land) for a month or more,
					occasionally venturing to private campgrounds for
					freedom-respecting festivals.
				</p>
				<h3>Key Offerings:</h3>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Mobile Agorist Businesses:</strong>
							Caravanarchy is equipped to deploy various
							businesses directly to new locations. For
							example, our Chew’s Wisely Ice Cream and Pizza
							operation embodies our "Ice Cream Philosophy":
							sourcing the finest quality ingredients from
							agorist producers to offer unparalleled
							products available only through the parallel
							market. If you want access to the best Ice
							Cream this reality has to offer, you have to
							go through the agorist market.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Network Hubs:</strong> Our caravan
							functions as both a network host (accepting
							and vetting new members) and a welcome
							outpost. We blend these capabilities with
							wings focused on outreach, protection, and
							other team-specific interests.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Abundance Loops:</strong> We are a
							primary creator of abundance loops within the
							network, fostering win-win exchanges where
							shelter/housing and other needs can be met
							through voluntary interaction. We are network
							support, designed to protect ourselves and
							others by fostering backup networks across
							various regions.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Education & Culture:</strong> We
							"peddle voluntaryism, not labor," offering
							talks, discussions, and fostering a vision to
							create the lore of a free society. We are the
							bards, creating festivals, stories, seminars,
							and voluntaryist media wherever we go,
							constantly nurturing new communities. The
							Workshop is a separate and complimentary
							gathering within the voluntarism outreach team
							that consists of people who teach certain
							skills and travel around or stay in one place
							offering information.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Skills & Infrastructure:</strong> We
							invest in mobile infrastructure and tools to
							sustain multiple agorist businesses on-the-go
							(e.g., pizzeria, burger bar, bakery
							equipment). This allows us to offer immediate
							opportunities for income redirection towards
							purely agorist sources, growing the wealth
							within the freedom-oriented family. We also
							offer solutions for urgent needs like
							self-protection or alternative housing.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Connecting Needs:</strong> We meet
							people in cities, set up temporary camps, draw
							individuals in, and provide tools to connect
							them with like-minded friends and
							opportunities, offering a superior alternative
							to the statist-quo.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Festival & Meetup Facilitation:</strong
							>
							We will meet up with people in different
							cities to start new festivals. We spend a
							month in an area at a time, where the caravan
							can recoup and secure gas money for the next
							destination. The main caravan will focus on a
							new location versus an older location, but
							yearly festivals will persist and other
							caravans will go wherever they please.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
					We retain a unique perspective based on our
					exposure to a diverse demographic of communities.
					We are historians and philosophers with a large
					sphere of influence. We do not need donations
					nearly as much as we need people on the ground.
					But donations will go towards a network that will
					provide for every one of us in the ways we want
					and need from our community.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>How to Become Nomadic</h2>
				<p>
					Not a nomad but want to be? We have several mobile
					spaces available if you have a vehicle but not one
					you can sleep in. Help with one of the jobs listed
					or live and work for yourself (preferably within
					the network), paying minimal rent and your own gas
					while following our caravan. Or you can trade your
					car into the network for barter.
				</p>
				<h3>Benefits of Mobile Life</h3>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Time:</strong> What are you able to do
							with your time?
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Location:</strong> You are able to
							position yourself in any location you want,
							choosing based on climate, culture, or being
							near loved ones.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<h3>Expenses of Mobile Life</h3>

				<h2>
					Getting Involved: Opportunities in Caravanarchy
				</h2>
				<p>
					Caravanarchy offers diverse ways to participate,
					whether you're seeking a temporary experience or a
					long-term commitment. We have a system for helping
					people transition from traditional urban lives and
					integrate into a freedom-focused existence.
				</p>
				<h3>Your Path to Freedom:</h3>
				<p>
					Wherever you are, you can benefit from the
					caravan. If you're looking to monetize your goods
					or services, we can help you find customers. If
					you travel with us, we will bring you to the
					marketplace. We have a solution for your lowest
					moment: we are here for you. Do you have a way to
					protect yourself? Need to get away or need another
					house? We’ll provide the details, you provide the
					specs — let's all be more sure about what we're
					going to get.
				</p>
				<p>
					You don't need to become a nomad, though we highly
					suggest taking some time to decompress from life's
					stressors, either on the road or at a stationary
					location. Many needs are fulfilled by our caravan.
					The point is not only to have people coming along
					with us but to connect people with things they
					need. We can use our boon to share with others
					what we have in excess. This is better than a road
					trip; on vacation, you are always going back to
					where you came from. With us, you are building a
					new life.
				</p>
				<h3>Joining the Caravan:</h3>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Traveler (Basic Position):</strong>
							Temporary visitors are welcome! You're
							primarily responsible for your own needs (gas,
							water, food, toiletries) and vehicle costs (if
							applicable). This is a great way to experience
							the caravan lifestyle. You will wake up every
							day knowing where the central caravan location
							is, where you can meet people, craft, and
							trade. Rarely, there is no central location
							and the people in the caravan do outreach in
							the town; in this case, the caravan main camp
							will be centered around a known friendly
							location.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Full-Time Crew / Core Team Member:</strong
							>
							For those seeking a deeper commitment,
							specific roles are available. By taking on one
							of these roles, you can become a full-time
							member, with associated benefits detailed
							below.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Transitional Members:</strong>
							Individuals seeking a non-caravan position or
							a permanent stationary location can still
							connect and find support through the network.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Emergency Support:</strong> Short-term
							roles focusing on specific, urgent needs.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Rideshare:</strong> Very short-term
							opportunities for transportation or delivery.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Guild Ambassadors:</strong> Variable
							terms, focused on representing Guilds within
							the caravan.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
					We are always seeking nomads to fill the roles
					needed to make the caravan a more highly
					functioning collective. Our caravan is growing—and
					with it sprouts new spaces for people who don’t
					yet have a vehicle to sleep in of their own.
					Everywhere we go, we have a huge camp offering and
					tables set up inviting folks to learn about the
					opportunities available in this ever-growing
					agorist network.
				</p>
				<h3>Caravan Roles: Join a Core Team!</h3>
				<p>
					By taking on one of these roles, you can earn your
					place as a full-time member. This is a list of
					roles that need to be filled in the caravan, or
					you can create one.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Caravan Coordination Crew:</strong>
							Manages overall caravan needs, events,
							mechanics, and security (including Emergency
							Preparedness Guild and Mobile Armed Militia
							operatives).
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Movement Crew:</strong> Consists of
							people who care about the caravan and have
							input pertinent to the next location and the
							timing of the movement. The caravan doesn’t
							move until they reach a consensus. Includes
							scouts for non-event private locations and
							outdoor locations.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Trade and Barter / Bounty Finding
								Crew:</strong
							>
							Facilitates exchanges, identifies needs, and
							helps direct caravan movement based on
							bounties. Help us find bounties on the road,
							and direct where the caravan will go next. We
							will follow the wisdom of the Movement Crew,
							but you can take trips near and far to meet
							bounties if the caravan is not going in the
							direction you find perfect.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Media Crew:</strong> Handles
							newsletter creation, maintains and updates
							media sources, spreads word of the newsletter,
							Bounty Board Upkeep, and Multi-level Privacy
							Map Upkeep to help expand the community’s map
							by adding and establishing places, and
							providing services to locations.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Caravan Inner Health Crew:</strong> A
							group of people who help the caravan by
							keeping track of the needs of the caravan,
							including Caravan Member Recruitment, managing
							Caravan Roles, ensuring Caravan Member
							Wellness, and Inner Caravan Errand Driving.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Outreach Crew:</strong> Organizes the
							Caravan Camp & Cafe, performances, speakers,
							DJs, other caravan talent, game nights
