			<h1>Network Hosts</h1>
			<div class="innersection">
				<p>For those seeking to swiftly transition into a life unburdened by coercive systems, Network Hosts offer a direct pathway to integration within our voluntary society. These dedicated individuals open their homes or properties for a defined period, providing guidance, resources, and connections to help guests find their optimal place within the expanding Network.</p>
				<p>
					The quickest way to completely remove
					yourself from your current life or the
					restrictions therein is to sign up for a
					visit with an agorist host. Because our
					network employs Voluntaryism Plus,
					Agorist Hosts provide a particular type
					of visit because it is also an entryway
					into the next realm. You can choose your
					rate of involvement. After a trial
					period at a property, your application
					may be accepted to join a network host
					environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Network hosts agree on a set period
					where they will open a section of their
					property or home to a guest with the
					intent of helping that person find a
					better place in the network - be that
					through finding a new living situation,
					job, or other personal development.
				</p>
				<p>
					Network hosts are not trying to get
					labor out of individuals. Their interest
					lies in introducing people to
					Voluntaryism and the nonaggression
					principle while providing them with an
					opportunity that is consistent with what
					they desire.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					A Network Host does not desire only to
					arrange work trade situations but to
					direct people into the network and into
					Guilds. Network Hosts may have a
					property they include in their hosting
					or they may meet with people at other
					spaces, like the caravan, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Want to be a Network Host? For a
					self-prescribed period of time, you
					provide services like water, food,
					shelter, information,&nbsp;
