			<h1>Voluntaryism Plus</h1>
			
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>Beyond Belief to Action</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Voluntaryism is the foundation. Voluntaryism <em>Plus</em> is the Network's framework for actually building free society. It's the difference between believing coercion is wrong and actively redirecting your resources away from coercive systems. Between agreeing with NAP principles and structuring your life to expand freedom for others, not just yourself.
				</p>
				<p>
					This page explains how the Network applies voluntaryist principles with strategic intention. If you haven't read <a href="3_IntroVoluntaryism.html">Intro to Voluntaryism</a> yet, start there. This builds on those concepts.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="callout">
				<p>
					"They are only leaders if you follow them" - Unknown
				</p>
				<p>
					"If a law suits me, I follow it..."
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2><strong><em>We are voluntaryists plus intention and discretion. Agorists plus urgency.</em></strong></h2>
				<p>
					Our approach is Voluntaryism with a twist. It's a call to move beyond simply believing in the philosophy to actively and intentionally building the world we want to see. We believe that to achieve a truly free society, we must be precise with our parameters. The core question is simple: <strong>Does your plan make the world more free for just yourself, or does it also enable freedom for others?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We don't judge those who only focus on their own autonomy, but we make a critical distinction in our own decisions. We prioritize doing business with those who share a similar commitment to expanding liberty for all.
				</p>

				<h3>The Call to Action: Take Your Freedom</h3>
				<p>
					Does a strong preference for voluntaryism make one a full-blown voluntaryist, even while their lifestyle perpetuates the State? Freedom is not a gift to be granted; it must be consciously and intentionally built.
				</p>
				<p>
					Look at where your resources flow. How far does your dollar go? How many transactions does it take before your wealth drains back into the State? Consider the people you trade with: are they bolstering our collective future with their time, energy, and focus? Or are they entangled in endeavors that ultimately strengthen the State, starving our support networks in the process? Once your basic needs are met, what do you do with your surplus? How are you choosing to live, and who benefits from your choices?
				</p>
				<p>
					Free Markets are at economic war with un-Free Markets. If you are a producer or provider, are you spending your time adding value to the lives of people who seek freedom from the State and its extortive impositions? If not, which side of the economic war are you fighting on? How much of what you earn goes into the hands of the enemy—the State and its war machine? We aim to make the free-market choice so superior that it becomes a no-brainer.
				</p>
				<p>
					We favor doing business with people who align with our pro-liberty, anti-government, anti-taxation, and pro-free-market ideals. These are the people we will go out of our way to serve and ensure customer satisfaction with. That said, if someone doesn't align with us but enjoys a good or service we provide, we are still glad they get to experience a small taste of what agorism and the free market can provide.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>The Strengths of Voluntaryism Plus</h2>
				<p>
					Adopting Voluntaryism Plus gives you clear goals for your interactions and a tangible roadmap toward a freer way of life. It's not just a philosophy; it's a strategy for living.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Keeping it in the Family:</strong>
							Your resources stay within our network, building our collective wealth and resilience.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Strength in Numbers:</strong> Every aligned interaction strengthens our community.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Win-Win Contracts:</strong> All agreements are mutually beneficial, based on consent and trust.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Abundance Loops:</strong> Our economic model generates more wealth and opportunity for all participants.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>The Time Machine:</strong> Our caravan and nomadic lifestyle accelerate the growth of the Network, bridging geographical gaps and creating more quality time for all involved.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>The Criteria for Engagement</h2>
				<p>
					We understand that stepping away from the state can be daunting. There is a natural, rational fear of putting your survival into the hands of a decentralized network. But true self-sufficiency is deepened through access to diverse connections, with privacy and security protected through tools like PGP. When your personal security is taken care of, you can focus on growing a network that provides a type of physical insurance and security unavailable in the statist world.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="innersection">
				<h4>For Individuals, Intention is the Criteria</h4>
				<p>
					Your intention is everything. If your goal is to be completely free of the government, are you open to the idea that your world would improve even more by serving the extended network?
				</p>
				<p>
					To be clear, we are looking for people who are committed to enabling both themselves and others to be free. We define this through three key criteria for every individual or group we work with:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Follows the NAP:</strong> Adherence to the non-aggression principle in all interactions.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Understands the Plan:</strong> A clear understanding of our vision for a voluntaryist society.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Extends the Vision:</strong> Has a personal plan that extends beyond their own survival to actively support others' freedom.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
					A self-sustaining business plan alone does not create a voluntaryist society; it merely allows a ship to float on a sea still claimed by the State. Your plan must help build the new sea.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="innersection">
				<h4>For Communities, Conflict Resolution is the Criteria</h4>
				<p>
					We mirror a pluralist society and allow ingenuity to guide our network's development. However, we form our structures on positive axioms. In every community, there is a method for resolving conflict. We encourage communities to clearly define the exact method of conflict resolution that they unanimously agree to employ. It serves every individual to understand and consent to the arbitration process before joining a community. This transparency is key to building trust in public spaces where disputes can arise.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="innersection">
				<h3>Examples of "Voluntaryism Plus" in Action</h3>
				<p>
					To make this philosophy tangible, let's look at how it manifests in the real world. These are not just ideas; they are active, daily choices that build the new world we envision.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>The Agorist Farmer:</strong> A permaculture farmer grows an abundance of food using sustainable methods, but their impact doesn't stop there. Instead of selling their produce at a state-run farmers market or through taxed grocery stores, they exclusively sell and barter their goods through a local agorist directory and to a network of like-minded individuals. They accept payment in decentralized cryptocurrency or other goods and services, ensuring every dollar earned stays within the free economy and directly bolsters the Network's strength. This farmer isn't just feeding themselves; they are fortifying the economic foundation of a free society.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>The Nomadic Developer:</strong> A skilled software developer chooses to live a minimalist, nomadic life. They don't just earn a living remotely; they dedicate their skills to building decentralized applications, secure communication platforms, and private directories for the Network. They accept payment exclusively in cryptocurrency or through barter, ensuring their income stream is entirely outside the State's grasp. By dedicating a portion of their time to these projects, they are building the essential digital infrastructure that empowers everyone's freedom and privacy.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>The Artisan Collective:</strong> A group of crafters, from weavers to woodworkers, wants to open a shared workshop. Instead of navigating restrictive zoning laws, costly permits, and bureaucratic inspections, they acquire a piece of private land. They build their workshop themselves, pooling their skills and resources to create a shared space completely free from state interference. By trading their creations directly with customers in the Agora, they are demonstrating that craftsmanship and community can flourish without government oversight.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="innersection">
				<h3>A Call to Introspection: A Self-Assessment</h3>
				<p>
					Ready to assess your own position in the economic war? The first step toward a life of intention is honest self-reflection. Ask yourself the following questions, and use the linked resources to help guide your journey.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Where does my income come from, and where does it go?</strong>
							Trace your resources from their origin to their destination. How much is spent on goods and services that fund state institutions?
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>What percentage of my energy is spent on complying with statist regulations versus building freedom?</strong>
							Are you spending more time filing taxes and filling out forms, or are you creating something new and free?
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Am I a net drain or a net contributor to the free market?</strong>
							Does your lifestyle perpetuate the State, or does it actively starve it of resources?
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>What is one small step I can take this week to align my resources with my values?</strong>
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>The Future: A Flourishing Pluralist Society</h3>
				<p>
					When enough individuals adopt the philosophy of Voluntaryism Plus, the result is a world beyond your wildest dreams—a world of flourishing pluralism.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<p>
						Imagine thousands of diverse, independent communities, each with its own unique culture, customs, and polycentric legal systems for conflict resolution. These communities are not isolated; they are interconnected by vibrant Agorist markets, Guilds, and nomadic caravans. This is a world where innovation thrives because there is no central authority to stifle it, where disputes are resolved through mediation and restitution, not violence and punishment, and where abundance replaces scarcity as the dominant mindset. This is the True Realm—a reality built on consent, creativity, and connection, where every person's path is a testament to the power of shared intention.
