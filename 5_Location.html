				<h3>Living Free, Anywhere</h3>
				<p>
					The concept of fixed residency often ties
					individuals to coercive systems, yet true freedom
					transcends geographical boundaries. "Transcending
					Location" explores the practicalities and
					philosophies of habitation within the Network,
					guiding you through diverse living arrangements,
					from nomadic lifestyles to establishing resilient
					stationary homesteads, all designed to maximize
					your autonomy.
				</p>
				<p>
					There has to be a reason behind what you do. The
					location you choose should be the best to serve
					that reason.
				</p>

						<strong>Locational Philosophy</strong>
					</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					The question is not whether to be stationary or
					nomadic, but to have a holistic plan for whatever
					option you do choose to go with at any point in
					time.
				</p>
				<p>
					And a holistic understanding of the pros and cons
					of each and how to transfer in between them.
				</p>
				<p>
					A location is only as safe as the contingency plan
					and its feasibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any one location is vulnerable. Having a backup is
					a step up. Having a huge network of people is
					closer to the objective by far. Every member of
					the network has some way to contribute to the
					Security Mesh.
				</p>
				<p>
					If people in your area desire to stay in a
					situation where a huge amount of their paycheck is
					going towards taxes and towards people who are
					also funding the state, it&rsquo;s probably a
					better idea to find different people or an area
					with people who are more willing to take seriously
					the task at hand. It is a lot bigger than just
					buying more agorist food. It is making sure that
					the work you are doing is also leading towards a
					more free future.

						>Nomadic or Stationary: Where We Fit with

				</h3>
				<p>
					A person needs a period to look at their life and
					figure what they would like to contribute. If you
					don&rsquo;t know yet, there are safe locations you
					can go to to be free of the restrictions of debt
					and rent that keep you chained.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no need to commit to one type of living
					when life is long and opportunities could take you
					anywhere. You can never know when your paradigm
					will shift or your plan A will become unavailable
					- that is why having redundancies and resilient
					networks is vital to our freedom. Each stage of
					regenerative land use and development is important
					and none can be left out. There are boons to both
					stationary and mobile locations when it comes to
					homes, projects and businesses alike. And there
					are cells that intersect these spaces in different
					ways and many do not depend on one length of stay
					in any location.

				<p>
					Not a nomad but want to be? If you have a vehicle
					but not one you can sleep in, we have several
					mobile spaces available to live and work for
					yourself (preferably within the network), paying
					minimal rent and your own gas while following our
					caravan. Or you can trade your car into the
					network for barter.

							Living a life unplugged from any forms of

					For those who don&rsquo;t see the value at this
					time in their life being a nomad, there are 0%
					impact properties where your presence can pay your
					rent at a location where you will be able to
					think, express yourself and hone in on what
					whatever you really value and desire; be it
					monetary, community, or personal. Humans deserve
					the space to grieve. They deserve enough space to
					take care of themselves.

					Every city can have a mobile help center that

					If there is not a festival around a certain

					can develop to provide year-round marketplace
					opportunities and agorist support to people in
					that area. It is not easy to be powerful with
					others and less you are acting in ways that are
					empowering.
