          An abundance loop is when you find a way to both
          thrive and have some excess prosperity. We are
          funneling this towards people who also can create
          abundance loops. The proliferation of abundance
          loops will spiral outwards from our own excess.
        </p>
        <p>
          As travelers, we are able to sell people's goods
          just by being where we were going to be already.
          Our gas money is already accounted for before we
          will even pick up and travel at all. You do not
          have to constantly burn gas to be a nomad - but
          when the network has a supply for the huge demand
          we currency face for agorist goods - it becomes
          very lucrative to travel. The opportunity to
          travel becomes too expensive to pass up.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is because within the reality we exist
          within, being a traveler is a boon as long as
          there are suppliers of products because there is
          always a market for agorist products. That is why
          it becomes important for us to crowdfund farms and
          producers of agorist goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a loop that says: We can do this. There is
          a need that they will fill. We have the extra
          piece that needed filling. We will work to fill in
          the missing piece instead of letting it thwart
          us.&nbsp;

          <h3><strong>Supply and Demand</strong></h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Supply and demand means that in a free market,
          producers will produce goods that they can sell
          and make a profit off of. But if there aren't
          enough customers for a product and not enough
          publicity, the producer will have no reason to try
          and create a market there. Just as someone would
          desire for a carbon tax upon behaviors that could
          damage the environment, we are advocating a
          government footprint statistic to be observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is much more wealth to be shared among our
          net worth than is currently being distributed
          within it. If the demand is no longer there for
          local goods in an area, that should not restrict
          someone from growing a crop or offering something.
          The caravan and individual people will fill in the
          network just says semi trucks due today for larger
          companies.&nbsp;

          Our aim is in allowing humans to make the
          decisions they would naturally make if they were
          presented with the option to. For example, people
          will choose the cheaper option that is higher
          quality and healthier.

            <strong>Concentration of Wealth</strong>
          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          In win-win interactions, there will always be two
          people who benefit. The other party in your
          interaction may be an ally or an enemy. This
          simple truth is one most neglected in their
          day-to-day transactions. In times both past and
          present, families would maintain economic
          dominance by passing on their wealth to the
          first-born son or daughter. While we neither
          support nor oppose such practices, we recognize
          the value of keeping your wealth within your
          agorist network rather than watching it bleed back
          into the system. You can expand this to
          &ldquo;resource sharing&rdquo; as well, choosing
          to specialize with or differentiate your offerings
          from others on your team.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your time and effort are put into acquiring
          products you know are of high value, you should
          try to pass that value on to trusted members of
          your network who will recognize and likely utilize
          your product (such as a quality truck you
          acquired) toward your common goal of abolishing
          slavery by ending the State by taking your agorism
          seriously and directing your wealth in a way that
          empowers yourself and the allies who are fighting
          the same fight you are.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you give your time and resources to another
          in a voluntary exchange, give to those who seek to
          concentrate their wealth into their
          network/family/community that focuses on
          manifesting anarchy beyond themselves. Is the
          person you're selling your goods/services to an
          anarchist who is actively seeking to manifest
          anarchy for others? Or are you giving your fruits
          away to be funneled/fed back into the statist
          paradigm/system? Vote with your wealth. Let your
          wealth work for you toward what you're here to
          accomplish: the abolishment of slavery and freedom
          of humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're going to take time and focus from other
          anarchists, do so in a way that focuses on
          manifesting anarchy for others. If you're going to
          seek help with things on your property that won't
          or don't manifest anarchy beyond yourself, then
          look for statists to fulfill those tasks since
          they'll at least be wasting their time in a way
          that benefits you while dodging government
          extortion fees ("taxes"). This then frees (or at
          least doesn't tie up) the time and focus of
          anarchists to manifest more freedom and grow the
          wealth and infrastructure of the network. Of
          course, that is not to say that you shouldn't pay
          other anarchists to tend your own garden for
          example, just don't pretend like that's in some
          way making the world more free if it doesn't do
          anything to actually free anybody.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's the taxation that fucking sucks, NOT the
          degree to which you feel misrepresented by your
          political overlords. You cannot be represented
          when you are one among 100,000 people in a sample
          size. Thats how you dilute your voice! There is
          only one right that needs to be protected - one
          right from which stems all others - and that it
          self ownership.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          When the US was started, there were less people to
          &ldquo;represent&rdquo; but still a monopoly over
          representation. If someone found they wanted to
          remain in their home town with their family
          history but not subscribe to a certain government
          law, shouldn&rsquo;t they be allowed to peacefully
          abstain?

          By choosing not to abide by the zero aggression

          It is important to define capitalism because the
          word has been used to divide us. But it is not
          irreparable that people now take Capitalism to
          mean the love of money - it is still important to
          describe the effects of greed with no
          accountability for the human or environmental
          cost. It is true that there is nothing worse than
          an action that hurts another person knowingly on
          behalf of personal profit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most who use the word capitalist to describe
          themselves would say that Capitalism is not greed,
          in fact, but something truly healing to society
          which we do not have the chance to observe today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Free market capitalism would still allow for all
          current safety precautions for example the
          creation of a myriad of restrictions and
          certifications that products could voluntarily
          subject themselves to in order to achieve higher

          A free market exists. People are getting their

        <p>
          That society grows and more people see the good
