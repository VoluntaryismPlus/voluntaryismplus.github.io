      <h1>Network Hosts</h1>
      <h3>Your Gateway to the Network</h3>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h3>
          Find people who are offering their land as a location for vetting and education purposes.
        </h3>
        <p>
          For those seeking to swiftly transition into a life unburdened by coercive systems, Network Hosts offer a direct pathway to integration within our voluntary society. These dedicated individuals open their homes or properties for a defined period, providing guidance, resources, and connections to help guests find their optimal place within the expanding Network.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The quickest way to completely remove yourself from your current life or the restrictions therein is to sign up for a visit with a Network Host.</strong> Because our network employs Voluntaryism Plus, Agorist Hosts provide a particular type of visit because it is also an entryway into the next realm. You can choose your rate of involvement. After a trial period at a property, your application may be accepted to join a network host environment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>What Network Hosts Do</h2>
        <p>
          Network hosts agree on a set period where they will open a section of their property or home to a guest with the intent of helping that person find a better place in the network—be that through finding a new living situation, job, or other personal development.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Network Host Goals:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Introduce people to Voluntaryism:</strong> Explain the philosophy through lived example</li>
            <li><strong>Teach the Non-Aggression Principle:</strong> Show how it works in practice</li>
            <li><strong>Provide opportunities:</strong> Help guests discover what they truly desire</li>
            <li><strong>Direct into the Network:</strong> Connect guests with Guilds, other hosts, resources</li>
            <li><strong>Vet new members:</strong> Build trust through extended interaction</li>
            <li><strong>Personal development:</strong> Help guests level up their freedom</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>Network hosts are not trying to get labor out of individuals.</strong> Their interest lies in introducing people to voluntaryism and the Non-Aggression Principle while providing them with an opportunity that is consistent with what they desire. While work-trade arrangements may be part of hosting, the primary goal is integration into the Network, not exploitation of labor.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Network Host does not desire only to arrange work-trade situations but to direct people into the network and into Guilds. Network Hosts may have a property they include in their hosting or they may meet with people at other spaces, like the caravan or at public gatherings.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="outerimage">
        <img src="img/hosts1.jpg" />
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Types of Network Hosts</h2>
        <p>
          There are several types of hosting arrangements within the Network, each serving different needs and offering different levels of integration.
        </p>

        <h3>General Network Hosts</h3>
        <p>
          These hosts provide a welcoming environment for people exploring voluntaryism and looking to connect with the Network. Stays are typically short to medium term (days to weeks), with emphasis on education and connection.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>What General Network Hosts Provide:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic necessities:</strong> Water, food, shelter for the agreed period</li>
            <li><strong>Information:</strong> Philosophy, Network structure, opportunities</li>
            <li><strong>Connections:</strong> Introductions to other members, Guilds, resources</li>
            <li><strong>Guidance:</strong> Help identifying your path within the Network</li>
            <li><strong>Vetting:</strong> Initial trust-building through direct interaction</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Agorist Hosts</h3>
        <p>
          Agorist Hosts go beyond general hosting—they actively practice counter-economics and can introduce you to agorist business models and practices. Staying with an Agorist Host is an entryway into deeper Network involvement.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
            <p>
              <em>You can think of Agorist Hosts as what WWOOFing could be if it gave back to the laborer. That combined with an introduction to the philosophies of voluntaryism—all with the goal of being introduced further into a Network of people who support each other and have higher-level security culture than those who traverse the mainstream world.</em>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>What Agorist Hosts Provide:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Counter-economic education:</strong> Learn agorist business practices firsthand</li>
            <li><strong>Trade opportunities:</strong> Participate in black/gray market transactions</li>
            <li><strong>Skill development:</strong> Learn trades outside credentialed systems</li>
            <li><strong>Income possibilities:</strong> Develop your own agorist income streams</li>
            <li><strong>Deep vetting:</strong> Extended interaction builds serious trust</li>
            <li><strong>Network integration:</strong> Transition from visitor to active member</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Training Hosts</h3>
        <p>
          Some hosts specialize in skill development—Freedom Guard training, Guild apprenticeships, or specific capabilities like permaculture, building, or technology.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Training Host Focus:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Structured learning programs</li>
            <li>Hands-on practice with experienced mentors</li>
            <li>Progression through skill levels</li>
            <li>Certification or recognition upon competency</li>
            <li>Connection to relevant Guilds</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Long-Term Hosts / Community Hosts</h3>
        <p>
          These hosts welcome people for extended stays (months to years) as they establish themselves in the Network. Properties may house multiple guests who form a community.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Long-Term Host Benefits:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Stable base while you build your agorist income</li>
            <li>Community of others on similar journeys</li>
            <li>Time to develop deep skills and connections</li>
            <li>Potential to become part of property collective</li>
            <li>Foundation for launching into full Network participation</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Becoming a Network Host</h2>
        <p>
          Want to be a Network Host? For a self-prescribed period of time, you provide services like water, food, shelter, and information to help integrate new members into the Network.
        </p>

        <h3>Requirements for Hosting</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Understand and practice voluntaryism:</strong> You're teaching by example</li>
            <li><strong>Have space available:</strong> Property, home, or access to facilities</li>
            <li><strong>Commit to defined periods:</strong> Be clear about how long you can host</li>
            <li><strong>Provide basic necessities:</strong> Or have systems for guests to provide their own</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge to share:</strong> Philosophy, skills, connections, or opportunities</li>
            <li><strong>Vetting capability:</strong> Ability to assess and vouch for guests</li>
            <li><strong>Network connections:</strong> Can introduce guests to others and resources</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Types of Hosting Arrangements</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Free hosting:</strong> You cover costs as contribution to the Network</li>
            <li><strong>Work-trade:</strong> Guests contribute labor in exchange for stay</li>
            <li><strong>Paid hosting:</strong> Guests pay for accommodations (agorist transaction)</li>
            <li><strong>Hybrid arrangements:</strong> Combination of above based on guest capabilities</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          The arrangement should be win-win. You're not exploiting guest labor, and guests aren't exploiting your hospitality. Clear agreements upfront prevent misunderstandings.
        </p>

        <h3>Benefits of Being a Host</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengthen the Network:</strong> Every person you help integrate multiplies Network capacity</li>
            <li><strong>Build your reputation:</strong> Successful hosting increases your standing</li>
            <li><strong>Find collaborators:</strong> Guests may become long-term partners or community members</li>
            <li><strong>Learn from guests:</strong> People bring diverse skills and perspectives</li>
            <li><strong>Economic opportunities:</strong> Hosting can generate agorist income</li>
            <li><strong>Make a difference:</strong> Directly help people escape unfree systems</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>For Guests: What to Expect</h2>
        <p>
          Visiting a Network Host is different from staying at a hotel or even a typical hostel. Here's what you should know:
        </p>

        <h3>Before You Visit</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Research the host:</strong> Read their profile, understand what they offer</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate clearly:</strong> What are you looking for? What can you offer?</li>
            <li><strong>Agree on terms:</strong> Duration, costs/trade, expectations, boundaries</li>
            <li><strong>Understand the philosophy:</strong> Read about voluntaryism and the NAP before arriving</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare for vetting:</strong> Hosts will assess whether you're a good fit for the Network</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>During Your Visit</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Respect property and boundaries:</strong> This is someone's home or land</li>
            <li><strong>Honor agreements:</strong> Do what you said you'd do</li>
            <li><strong>Be curious and engaged:</strong> Ask questions, learn, participate</li>
            <li><strong>Contribute value:</strong> Even if hosting is free, find ways to help</li>
            <li><strong>Build relationships:</strong> Host and other guests are potential long-term connections</li>
            <li><strong>Be honest about your goals:</strong> What do you want from the Network?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>After Your Visit</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Follow up:</strong> Thank the host, share your experience</li>
            <li><strong>Continue engagement:</strong> Stay connected with people you met</li>
            <li><strong>Act on what you learned:</strong> Apply philosophy and skills</li>
            <li><strong>Pay it forward:</strong> Help others as you were helped</li>
            <li><strong>Potentially become a host yourself:</strong> Once you're established, open your space to others</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Alternative Vetting Pathways</h2>
        <p>
          For people who do not wish to be vetted through hosting arrangements, you can also be vetted by someone at a <a href="2_welcomedesk.html">Welcome Desk</a>—a public-facing location where Network members meet newcomers, answer questions, and provide initial orientation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other vetting pathways include:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Attending meetups and events:</strong> Regular participation builds trust</li>
            <li><strong>Marketplace reputation:</strong> Successful trades demonstrate trustworthiness</li>
            <li><strong>Guild membership:</strong> Skill development and professional reputation</li>
            <li><strong>Caravan participation:</strong> Traveling with the caravan provides intensive vetting</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          See <a href="4_admissions.html">Admissions Portal</a> for full details on all vetting pathways.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Finding and Listing Hosts</h2>
        <p>
          Network Hosts are listed in the private Network Directory (accessible to vetted members). If you're not yet vetted, you can:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li>Attend public events where hosts may be present</li>
            <li>Contact the caravan (which functions as a mobile host)</li>
            <li>Visit a Welcome Desk for introductions</li>
            <li>Connect through trusted mutual contacts</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          Once vetted, you'll have access to detailed host profiles showing:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li>Location (general area, specific address shared after contact)</li>
            <li>Type of hosting (general, agorist, training, long-term)</li>
            <li>Availability and duration</li>
            <li>What they provide and what they expect</li>
            <li>Skills they can teach or connections they offer</li>
            <li>Reviews from previous guests</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>The Hosting Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>
          Network Hosts are a critical piece of the larger ecosystem. They provide:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Entry points:</strong> Safe ways for newcomers to enter the Network</li>
            <li><strong>Vetting infrastructure:</strong> Personal interaction for trust-building</li>
            <li><strong>Education hubs:</strong> Living examples of voluntaryist principles</li>
            <li><strong>Transition support:</strong> Help leaving old systems and entering new ones</li>
            <li><strong>Community nodes:</strong> Gathering points for Network members</li>
            <li><strong>Economic activity:</strong> Locations for agorist business and trade</li>
            <li><strong>Security mesh:</strong> Distributed safe locations across geography</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          As the Network grows, the hosting ecosystem becomes more robust—more hosts in more locations offering more specializations. This creates redundancy and resilience. If one host becomes unavailable, others fill the gap. No single point of failure.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h3>Your Next Steps</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>For Guests:</strong> Ready to visit a Network Host? Start by attending public events or contacting a Welcome Desk for initial connections. Once you have basic vetting, you'll gain access to the host directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>For Potential Hosts:</strong> Want to open your property to Network members? Connect with existing hosts to learn best practices, then list yourself in the directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Continue Exploring the Network:</strong>

        <h2>Conclusion: The Workshop Complete</h2>
        <p>
          You've now completed The Workshop—all three subsections covering Getting Started, Skill Development, and Network Structure. You understand the philosophy (from The Library), you know how to take action (from The Workshop), and you're ready to engage with the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next step is yours. Will you visit a host? Join a Guild? Attend a meetup? Start your own counter-economic venture? The Network is here to support whatever path you choose—as long as it honors the Non-Aggression Principle and advances freedom.
