					Find people who are offering their land as a
					location for vetting and education purposes.

				<p>
					For those seeking to swiftly transition into a
					life unburdened by coercive systems, Network Hosts
					offer a direct pathway to integration within our
					voluntary society. These dedicated individuals
					open their homes or properties for a defined
					period, providing guidance, resources, and
					connections to help guests find their optimal
					place within the expanding Network.
				</p>
				<p>
					The quickest way to completely remove yourself
					from your current life or the restrictions therein
					is to sign up for a visit with an agorist host.
					Because our network employs Voluntaryism Plus,
					Agorist Hosts provide a particular type of visit
					because it is also an entryway into the next
					realm. You can choose your rate of involvement.
					After a trial period at a property, your
					application may be accepted to join a network host
					environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Network hosts agree on a set period where they
					will open a section of their property or home to a
					guest with the intent of helping that person find
					a better place in the network - be that through
					finding a new living situation, job, or other
					personal development.
				</p>
				<p>
					Network hosts are not trying to get labor out of
					individuals. Their interest lies in introducing
					people to Voluntaryism and the nonaggression
					principle while providing them with an opportunity
					that is consistent with what they desire.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					A Network Host does not desire only to arrange
					work trade situations but to direct people into
					the network and into Guilds. Network Hosts may
					have a property they include in their hosting or
					they may meet with people at other spaces, like
					the caravan, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Want to be a Network Host? For a self-prescribed
					period of time, you provide services like water,
					food, shelter, information,&nbsp;
