        <em>Why Agorism Works</em>
      </h1>

        <p>
          Agorism, the philosophy of achieving freedom
          through nonviolent black and grey market
          economics, has been practiced as long as humanity
          has sought liberty. This page explores the
          fundamental principles, economic arguments, and
          overarching vision behind agorism, revealing why
          it is the most effective path to dismantling the
          state and cultivating genuine societal freedom.

        <p>
          To us, agorism is where all actions lead towards
          bringing down the state (the biggest current
          threat to freedom) by illegitimizing its
          involuntary strategies through counter-economics.
          This can happen as quickly as we make it happen.
          The scope of what is possible in the next 1-10
          years is what has been lacking in most of the
          freedom spaces we have seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agorism as we see it is a strategy one can employ
          in order to fight, reduce, or obsolete the state
          through counter-economics. To align ideologically
          with agorism does not make one an agorist. Agorism
          acknowledges that there is an economic war between
          free markets and State-controlled and extorted
          markets. By your lifestyle, actions, career, and
          economic choices, you choose which side of that
          war you stand on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Animal rights aside, it is more ethical to consume
          agorist beef than it is to consume organic vegan
          produce that you bought at a grocery store if you
          look at all the taxes that were extorted through
          the life of the product. The only murder you are
          funding was of one cow who you could verify was
          treated well vs. the exploitation of everyone
          (including murder and death of innocents) when you
          buy groceries. The focus that will bring us
          together and sustain us is around how you choose
          the outer network you are supporting. But when the
          goods and services offered in the network are too
          expensive, it can&rsquo;t get going nor remain
          sustainable or accessible to its
          &ldquo;affiliates&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most important for all members of the network is
          the understanding of how things are when there are
          no government restrictions, only private people
          handling their own business. They have to
          understand that the problem is not with one thing
          or another, it's not with the language but with
          the story itself.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Why don&rsquo;t we write plans in which we are the
          number one hero of our own life, pursuing our
          wildest fantasies? It&rsquo;s not our fault - we
          are tricked. We are told we will be persecuted by
          the government if we pursue means that give us the
          freedom to flourish and grow resilient networks.
          Instead, each person is living in an isolated node
          of a largely directionless network of people,
          unable to offer even their own eyes as backup to a
          network they actually would benefit from
          supporting. We have to create a new option. The
          option where people choose for themselves.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="innersection">
        <p>
          If you could choose how many sources you wanted
          when it came to organic produce, it might be easy
          to imagine paring it down to a handful of local
          farms for your groceries - but if it came down to
          choosing a police force that would either protect
          you in a time of need or potentially take you to a
          cage for any number of reasons whenever they
          encounter you, having another option can be a
          matter of life or death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why don&rsquo;t we have more choices when it comes
          to the protection agencies we fund and are subject
          to in our own spaces? That is a whole other
          discussion but the answer to meeting the needs of
          society is a free market where consumers are
          allowed to choose the services they want to
          subscribe to and the agencies they want to be
          involved in. That market is something each of us
          have the fortune of securing in this time and for
          generations to come.

        <p>
          An abundance loop is when you find a way to both
          thrive and have some excess prosperity. We are
          funneling this towards people who also can create
          abundance loops. The proliferation of abundance
          loops will spiral outwards from our own excess.
        </p>
        <p>
          As travelers, we are able to sell people's goods
          just by being where we were going to be already.
          Our gas money is already accounted for before we
          will even pick up and travel at all. You do not
          have to constantly burn gas to be a nomad - but
          when the network has a supply for the huge demand
          we currency face for agorist goods - it becomes
          very lucrative to travel. The opportunity to
          travel becomes too expensive to pass up.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is because within the reality we exist
          within, being a traveler is a boon as long as
          there are suppliers of products because there is
          always a market for agorist products. That is why
          it becomes important for us to crowdfund farms and
          producers of agorist goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a loop that says: We can do this. There is
          a need that they will fill. We have the extra
          piece that needed filling. We will work to fill in
          the missing piece instead of letting it thwart
          us.&nbsp;

          <h3><strong>Supply and Demand</strong></h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Supply and demand means that in a free market,
          producers will produce goods that they can sell
          and make a profit off of. But if there aren't
          enough customers for a product and not enough
          publicity, the producer will have no reason to try
          and create a market there. Just as someone would
          desire for a carbon tax upon behaviors that could
          damage the environment, we are advocating a
          government footprint statistic to be observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is much more wealth to be shared among our
          net worth than is currently being distributed
          within it. If the demand is no longer there for
          local goods in an area, that should not restrict
          someone from growing a crop or offering something.
          The caravan and individual people will fill in the
          network just says semi trucks due today for larger
          companies.&nbsp;

        <p>
          Our aim is in allowing humans to make the
          decisions they would naturally make if they were
          presented with the option to. For example, people
          will choose the cheaper option that is higher
          quality and healthier.

            <strong>Concentration of Wealth</strong>
          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          In win-win interactions, there will always be two
          people who benefit. The other party in your
          interaction may be an ally or an enemy. This
          simple truth is one most neglected in their
          day-to-day transactions. In times both past and
          present, families would maintain economic
          dominance by passing on their wealth to the
          first-born son or daughter. While we neither
          support nor oppose such practices, we recognize
          the value of keeping your wealth within your
          agorist network rather than watching it bleed back
          into the system. You can expand this to
          &ldquo;resource sharing&rdquo; as well, choosing
          to specialize with or differentiate your offerings
          from others on your team.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your time and effort are put into acquiring
          products you know are of high value, you should
          try to pass that value on to trusted members of
          your network who will recognize and likely utilize
          your product (such as a quality truck you
          acquired) toward your common goal of abolishing
          slavery by ending the State by taking your agorism
          seriously and directing your wealth in a way that
          empowers yourself and the allies who are fighting
          the same fight you are.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you give your time and resources to another
          in a voluntary exchange, give to those who seek to
          concentrate their wealth into their
          network/family/community that focuses on
          manifesting anarchy beyond themselves. Is the
          person you're selling your goods/services to an
          anarchist who is actively seeking to manifest
          anarchy for others? Or are you giving your fruits
          away to be funneled/fed back into the statist
          paradigm/system? Vote with your wealth. Let your
          wealth work for you toward what you're here to
          accomplish: the abolishment of slavery and freedom
          of humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're going to take time and focus from other
          anarchists, do so in a way that focuses on
          manifesting anarchy for others. If you're going to
          seek help with things on your property that won't
          or don't manifest anarchy beyond yourself, then
          look for statists to fulfill those tasks since
          they'll at least be wasting their time in a way
          that benefits you while dodging government
          extortion fees ("taxes"). This then frees (or at
          least doesn't tie up) the time and focus of
          anarchists to manifest more freedom and grow the
          wealth and infrastructure of the network. Of
          course, that is not to say that you shouldn't pay
          other anarchists to tend your own garden for
          example, just don't pretend like that's in some
          way making the world more free if it doesn't do
          anything to actually free anybody.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's the taxation that fucking sucks, NOT the
          degree to which you feel misrepresented by your
          political overlords. You cannot be represented
          when you are one among 100,000 people in a sample
          size. Thats how you dilute your voice! There is
          only one right that needs to be protected - one
          right from which stems all others - and that it
          self ownership.&nbsp;

          When the US was started, there were less people to
          &ldquo;represent&rdquo; but still a monopoly over
          representation. If someone found they wanted to
          remain in their home town with their family
          history but not subscribe to a certain government
          law, shouldn&rsquo;t they be allowed to peacefully
          abstain?

      <h2>The Agorist Economic Advantage</h2><p>We have a method to support and bolster the supply of goods and services by providing an ever-growing supply and demand for these resources. This is accomplished through intentional networking and establishing trade relationships and contracts with individuals who share our aim of bringing about the best of all possible worlds by making the world more free for others. We also aim to minimize if not eliminate altogether the number of fiscal transactions we engage in with unknown or unvetted individuals, especially those who haven’t demonstrated a desire to be free from the taxes and regulations imposed on them by the State.

</p><p>When we work within the private realm and don’t spend our resources on government licenses and taxes, there are more resources concentrated within the Network of freedom-bringers. This brings the price for Network goods down, making them more accessible and allows them a competitive advantage over the Matrix market. Networks can provide these high-value goods and services to those still stuck in the Matrix, introducing them to the abundance of the Network without requiring them to understand the philosophy. This results in stronger, larger agorist networks and market opportunities.

        </p><p>Success looks like a network that can provide people with what they need to make their lives better in the absence of compulsory fees or restrictions getting between suppliers and customers. This results in alternate income streams, careers, training, and education. A multitude of options of superior value become available from this strategy when it comes to food, supplies, and services. Alternate healthcare, insurance, arbitration as well as alternate entertainment venues and community meeting spaces become available to more individuals as the network grows.</p>

          organize itself in a dynamic, fluid way. And it
          also needs a human. In itself, a business can have
          built into it a philosophy and methodology that
          makes sure it does not become a negative entity,
          but it needs humans to enforce that methodology

          It is important to define capitalism because the
          word has been used to divide us. But it is not
          irreparable that people now take Capitalism to
          mean the love of money - it is still important to
          describe the effects of greed with no
          accountability for the human or environmental
          cost. It is true that there is nothing worse than
          an action that hurts another person knowingly on
          behalf of personal profit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most who use the word capitalist to describe
          themselves would say that Capitalism is not greed,
          in fact, but something truly healing to society
          which we do not have the chance to observe today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Free market capitalism would still allow for all
          current safety precautions for example the
          creation of a myriad of restrictions and
          certifications that products could voluntarily
          subject themselves to in order to achieve higher
          customer satisfaction.

          They say that a better future starts with an

          a bit too small-minded. Let's all expand our ideas

          A society can be achieved that is utopian
          voluntarily in this way:
        </p>
        <p>
          A free market exists. People are getting their
          needs met and we are experiencing the real return
          of our labor and technological advancements.
        </p>
        <p>
          A society forms which is doing away with all forms
          of toiling that aren&rsquo;t done freely out of
          passion.
        </p>
        <p>
          That society grows and more people see the good
          things about it. It develops as it grows and
          learns to accommodate larger amounts of people,
          breaking down into local groups that can choose
          their own ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          That society voluntarily replaces the current form
          of society because it provides better than what

        <h3>Keeping the Money in the Network</h3>
        <p>
          If you want to trade or give, put your resources
          into people who will make us all more free. When
          you provide goods or services to others, what does
          your energy and time result in? Does it go into a
          network whose growth directly helps and protects
          you, or do your efforts end up funding the state
          down the line?
        </p>
        <p>
          To answer the above question, it is imperative
          that you consider your business contacts and
          customer base. When those you work and do business
          with go back into their lives, are they using the
          energy produced by your trade to create more
          freedom for others? Or are they spending their
          time working within the confines of the State,
          bleeding their energy into its evil machinery
          through their income, housing and other
          interactions?
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <div class="calloutcenter">
            <p>
              When choosing who to sell to or buy from, ask
              yourself:<br />
              "Who is going to be a targeted missile
              directed towards what I would like to
              achieve?"
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          It makes more sense to provide goods and services
          to people who are keeping their energy inside the
          network so that the wealth and prosperity we all
          share can be multiplied instead of pilfered away
          into the enemy’s reserves.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we work within the private realm and don’t
          spend our resources on government licenses and
          taxes, there are more resources concentrated
          within the Network of freedom-bringers. This
          brings the price for Network goods down, making
          them more accessible and allows them a competitive
          advantage over the Matrix market. Networks can
          provide these high-value goods and services to
          those still stuck in the Matrix, introducing them
          to the abundance of the Network without requiring
          them to understand the philosophy. This results in
          stronger, larger agorist networks and market
          opportunities.

              Everything you do is effort and resources.
              Nothing you possess has been received free

        <p>
          Be discerning when you offer help to someone. It
          does the most good to help people who are using
          their life to achieve the greatest good, which is
          making the world more free for themselves and
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s too much of a risk to spend money or give to
          charity when you cannot ensure it won’t bleed back
          into the State. This includes giving to
          individuals who aren’t making the world more free
          for others. If you give to someone without knowing
          what that person is doing with their resources,
          you are saying “I don’t matter. My time doesn’t
          matter and my efforts are for nothing”. Money can
          be thought of as a source of potential energy, and
          you get to choose what that energy will support.
        </p>
        <p>
          You only have one moment, and endless options for
          where to put your time, energy and resources. If
          you want to grow a network that will become
          prosperous and protect your future, support those
          whose actions lead towards freedom and prosperity
          for all instead of towards making themselves more
          comfortable within a cage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone you give to can be seen as a river of
          potential. If you toss resources into a river,
          throw them into one that leads to freedom for
          others instead of towards apathy and inaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vote with your wallet. Create the world you want
          to see. It doesn’t help in our economic war
          against the State to give energy or resources to
          people who aren’t trying to make the world more
          free for others. There are people who want a
          better option and who see that there is a need to
          put their money into a network that ensures the
          safety of their person, property, and freedom. The
          Network provides them with an option that they
          desperately need. This is a network that is able
          to protect their physical security and the
          products of their labor in a way that is missing
          in the current paradigm.

            <h4>Prudent Discrimination</h4>
            <p>
              Discriminate against people who are working to
              reduce human freedom, be it actively or
              through vocal support. If you have a different
              opinion than someone, look at whether their
              opinion requires others to lose their freedom.
              If you are not sure, ask them directly where
              they draw their line between what they will or
              won't allow from those who think differently
              from them. Do they believe people who think
              differently should be free to take different
              actions and fund different initiatives, while
              being free to opt out of funding things they
              did not choose or support?

              <br /><br />Discrimination does not
              necessarily imply ex-communication. Rather, it
              is about prioritizing interactions and
              exchanges based on your own framework of
              judgement. It is always better to give your
              time and energey toward people who are working
              to make the world more free for others, rather
              than less free.

      <h3>Policing The Cops</h3>
      <p>
We will create a list of instances of police brutality and do an analysis. Ask questions like:
        </p>
        <p>What if anybody who wasn't a cop did that?
        </p>
        <p>How would we have done that?
        </p>
        <p>Give our notes on it, and give an update in a future article if there is a development in the case.
        </p>
        <p>The Safest Place to Hide: Behind a Badge
        </p>
        <p>“I don’t have any compassion for police. Some people have just come to such bad conclusions with what they did with their lives..they would need to apologize a lot. And denounce police and any form of legitimacy to the profession of “Government Police Officer”
        </p>
        <p>Is being a cop a form of mental illness? It certainly is a symptom of mental illness. It means you’re involved in a violent gang.

        <h3>Police State</h3>
<p>As if violence doesn’t count when “the government” does it.
        </p>
        <p>Some have a hard time divorcing the idea of police, firefighters and other government workers as being often good people with good intentions who don't all agree with all the laws they are told to enforce. But if fully functioning adults can reach an understanding of voluntary action, why don’t we ask people who choose to assert their laws onto others to have the same mental clarity? We draw a hard line with this just as we do with anyone who wants to use politics to undo politics - why waste your time? If you are ever asked to compromise your morals, and you do, have you not become someone you yourself would disagree with?
        </p>
        <p>The idea that the police will show upholds a different weight and implication for each individual, and in most moments, including the moments before the “legalized” force shows up at a location, there exists voluntaryism and it is only the beliefs of the individuals present that bind them to any “law” (politician’s opinions backed by force).
        </p>
        <p>There is so much cognitive dissonance in the modern person's mind. They have to make up reasons why they can’t identify with you. So they have to project onto you that you are somehow scary or successful or something that they’re not. They have to “other” you.
        </p>
        <h3>ABC’s of the Alphabet Soup</h3>
<p>Do we have sympathy for those who do not know there is another way? For those who think they can change it from the inside? The inside is immovable. With regards to government, the main function of it is not designed to change.</p>
      <h3>Voting: An opinion with a gun</h3>
        <h4>Comply or die</h4>
      <p>
All laws are death threats because the state would always rather kill you than let you be free to successfully thwart their claim of authority. They are terrified of that, on some level.
</p>
        <p>I know lots of people who don’t vote. I used to vote, but now I see why it’s bad.
</p>
        <p>The lesser of two evils argument:
</p>
        <p>The worst evil is people still believing they have to be controlled my the government
</p>
        <p>You're saying it's okay if you are gonna take advantage and start aggressing
</p>
        <p>Then you have no right to complain if they want to do the same thing back</p>
      <h3>Beyond Utopian Ideal Societies</h3>
      <p>
There are a lot more things we can agree on in society than most people understand. Often, anarchists are brushed off as idealistic. As wanting to create something that has no means for purchase. Anarchists are not the only ones who want to see their ideals in the world. But anarchists do not push onto others their own ideals. They want to follow ideals that all can agree on, that allow people to organize naturally and logically by preference and need.
</p>
        <p>Many people like small government - they believe the government is needed for things like national defense, and these people are idealizing what is possible through government.
</p>
        <p>There are other popular ideals that apply to utopian scenarios. The desire to eradicate money.
Money itself is not evil.
<h3>Post Scarcity:</h3>
<p>Some want helpless people to be taken care of and the only way they can imagine to achieve that is through coercive taxes. Yet aren’t most people altruistic? We believe charity will continue to be a big priority for those people and that it will be hundreds of times more effective in an anarchist society. Trust your fellow man to fund important things that you can subscribe to without being forced to. With no mandatory, superfluous taxes, more money in pockets makes for more win-win.
</p>
        <p>Then there are people who want every person to have some kind of support system through the government because they believe that some people just can’t make it without that. And these people are underestimating what will happen after voluntaryism as well. There will be many more jobs for people and many more things to do to better your life.
</p>
        <p>In the future, there will be a point in time where what is called the “law” has no effect on how anyone acts at any point in time ever. The “state” would be seen as nothing more than a joke. And we are planning for that day.</p>
      <h3>Against Monetization Of Ideas</h3>
      <h4>
Information to Better Others
</h4>
        <p>All things that can help each other shall be freely given. If they have the will to learn, let them learn. And teach themselves. Let us give to the next system in every way we can so that it can deliver to us the protection we deserve.
</p>
        <h3>Why money is good:
</h3>
        <p>There is a need for some form of divisible currency. I cannot trade 40 sheep for one half of a car, if my car-selling friend wants some sheep. I cannot always make exact change in my trade. But can we handle that? Is the love of money the root of evil?
</p>
        <p>We don’t think so. But we understand the reasons why it may seem so. If you have no human purpose behind a project, it will not necessarily be human-positive. This restriction only applies to unnatural processes, however. Decentralized things like the free market do not mix well with intention and design.</p></div>
