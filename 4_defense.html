                    Without a doubt, the best strategy for
                    collective defense of a society is to
                    avoid armed conflict in the first place.
                    Anarchist societies can do a far better
                    job of avoiding conflict than states
                    can. I will explain… While certainly not
                    the only factor in decisions regarding
                    whether or not to go to war, the most
                    important one is a cost/benefit
                    analysis. It can generally be said that
                    if a potential war will provide little
                    utility to those who decide to embark on
                    it, and that it will be costly, it most
                    likely will not happen. This implies
                    that states are likely to be highly
                    aggressive, because the costs of wars
                    are not borne by the politicians, but by
                    tax-victims who are forced to fund them.
                </p><p> Additionally, the politician’s cronies
                    who profit from war (suppliers of bombs,
                    bullets, guns, uniforms, tanks, jets,
                    ships and other machines of destruction
                    used in war - also known as the
                    military-industrial-complex) can
                    certainly get significant benefits from
                    it! </p><p> Stateless societies, where those who
                    choose to make war must fund it fully
                    themselves, are far less likely to be
                    aggressive. And luckily, what is needed
                    for effective defense is far less
                    expensive than what is required for
                    military aggression. A stateless society
                    can drastically reduce the chance of
                    conflict by making it costly to invade,
                    and with as little benefit as possible
                    to the invader. </p><p> Without an already
                    existing state in place, there will be
                    no command center for the foreign
                    aggressor to take over. Rather than
                    simply taking over the capitol and using
                    the already existing and “legitimized”
                    state apparatus to extract taxes from
                    the populace, the invader will need to
                    win the war neighborhood by
                    neighborhood. And if they succeed,
                    they’ll need to create all the
                    infrastructure needed to govern the
                    hostile territory before being able to
                    take from it. In short, there would
                    likely be very little to gain from
                    attacking a stateless territory, at
                    least financially. Contrast this with
                    the possibility of invading a small
                    state with a weak military. There is
                    already an apparatus for control and
                    administration in place, and likely only
                    government defense institutions rather
                    than a decentralized network of private
                    ones. Given that there are many
                    governments today with weak militaries,
                    they would be superior targets for
                    invasion than a stateless region. And
                    since these weaker states aren’t being
                    constantly invaded in today’s world,
                    that provides some evidence that large
                    states may not be all that aggressive
                    against a stateless society. You might
                    want to double-check these facts, but
                    from what I found, there are 16
                    countries today without any military
                    forces whatsoever, including noteworthy
                    examples like Costa Rica and
                    Liechtenstein, which hasn’t had a
                    military since 1868. This is all well
                    and good in terms of the economic
                    motivations for war, but war is
                    sometimes about more than that, isn’t
                    it? There can be ideological or
                    geopolitical motivations as well. In a
                    stateless society, there would be no
                    government to engage in significant
                    disputes with foreign governments, and
                    thus eliminate many of the potential
                    causes for war. There may be individuals
                    in the ungoverned area that are hostile
                    to a particular state, but that foreign
                    government will feel far less threatened
                    by some hostile individuals than a
                    hostile government. In addition,
                    stateless societies would not be players
                    in the power games and competition for
                    domination in an area. There would be no
                    standing army, and the society would not
                    act as a single agent, so foreign
                    governments will feel less threatened by
                    the “power” of a stateless region. If
                    still, a foreign army chose to invade,
                    it would be clear to the subjects of the
                    aggresing state that their government is
                    in the wrong, which will decrease the
                    aggressing state’s legitimacy in their
                    eyes. With legitimacy being the source
                    of the state’s power (the legitimacy of
                    the State rests upon a perception of
                    “consent of the governed”), going to war
                    with a stateless region that has not
                    standing military and is not perceived
                    as a threat to the invading state, would
                    be a dangerous game for them to play.
                    Nevertheless, it would be naive to argue
                    that a stateless society will never be
                    invaded. But there are some easy ways
                    that a stateless society could make it
                    as costly as possible. For instance,
                    protection agencies (being those who are
                    most threatened by a potential foreign
                    invasion) can put bounties on the heads
                    of state officials to encourage
                    insurrection and privateering (there is
                    a REALLY neat video about something
                    known as the “Assassination market” and
                    “Assassination Politics” you should
                    check out, which was conceived by a man
                    by the name of Jim Bell). They can also
                    assassinate those public officials, or
                    create the credible threat that they
                    could do so. Since protection agencies
                    will be practiced at
                    capturing/apprehending people,
                    assassination or kidnap might be
                    something they’re good at. Note:
                    Government decision makers are far less
                    likely to go to war if they know that it
                    is their heads which are on the line.
                    Protection agencies in a stateless
                    region should ensure that the threat of
                    retaliation is squarely on the
                    political/military leaders, and not the
                    soldiers and civilians of the foreign
                    country. In fact, they can offer
                    sanctuary or perhaps money to foreign
                    soldiers in exchange for their
                    desertion. If deserters bring some
                    weapons with them, surely protection
                    agencies would be willing to pay for
                    those as well, and the local businesses,
                    having no blind allegiances to any
                    centralized government (“patriotism”)
                    may even welcome the invaders, seeing
                    them as potential customers! But
                    couldn’t states, such as the US or
                    Russia, just nuke the stateless regions?
                    Technically yes, but remember that
                    states can also nuke other states, and
                    would have more reason to do so. Nuking
                    a stateless region would offer no gain,
                    would have long-lasting environmental
                    impacts that could damage the aggressor
                    state, and there would almost certainly
                    be a loss of legitimacy internally in
                    the eyes of the invading state’s
                    subjects. To sum up, there are many
                    reasons to believe that a stateless
                    society would have drastically lower
                    needs for defense than a state would,
                    and is unlikely to be attacked. In
                    effect, the problem solves itself when
                    the state apparatus is dissolved, but in
                    the off chance that an invasion against
                    a stateless society did occur, the
                    market would already have a plurality of
                    competing protection services (and other
                    market entities) ready to respond in a
                    variety of ways. Because it is in the
                    best interests of those individual
                    agencies (and their customers) to do so
                    effectively and efficiently, they (the
                    competing agencies) wouldn't even need a
                    standing army or centralized power to do
                    so, and the thought of having one would
                    be silly when compared to all of the
                    more effective (both in function and
                    cost) defense strategies available in a
                    free, adaptable and unfettered market.
