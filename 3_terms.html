        <h3>A Comprehensive Glossary</h3>

        <p>
          Clear communication requires shared definitions.
          This page provides precise definitions for key
          terms used throughout the Network and the broader
          voluntaryist movement. Whether you're new to these
          concepts or just need a quick reference, this
          glossary ensures we're all speaking the same
          language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Terms are organized alphabetically within
          categories for easy reference. For deeper
          exploration of any concept, follow the links to
          relevant pages in The Library or Workshop.

        <h2>Core Philosophy</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Anarchy / Anarchism</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>An-</strong> (without) +
            <strong>-archy</strong> (rulers). A social order
            and economic structure based on voluntary
            cooperation without institutionalized authority
            or coercive government. Not chaos or disorder,
            but rather self-organization without imposed
            hierarchy. See
            <a href="3_IntroVoluntaryism.html"
              >Intro to Voluntaryism</a
            >

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Voluntaryism</h4>
          <p>
            The moral philosophy that all human interaction
            should be voluntary and consensual. Voluntaryism
            rejects the initiation of force in all forms
            including violence, theft, fraud, and coercion.
            It permits defensive force only. Voluntaryism
            holds that no person or group has legitimate
            authority over another. See
            <a href="3_IntroVoluntaryism.html"
              >Intro to Voluntaryism</a
            >.

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Counter-Economics</h4>
          <p>
            The act of engagment in peaceful human action that the state has
            forbidden, regulated, or taxed. This includes
            black markets (illegal), grey markets
            (unregulated), and any economic activity
            conducted outside state supervision.
            
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Agorism</h4>
          <p>
            The strategy of using counter-economics to build a free society
            and starve the state. Coined by Samuel Edward
            Konkin III, the term comes from "agora," the
            ancient Greek marketplace. See
            <a href="3_WhyAgorismWorks.html"
              >Why Agorism Works</a

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>The State</h4>
          <p>
            A compulsory institution claiming a territorial monopoly
            on the legitimate use of force. The state
            extracts resources through taxation (coercive
            funding) and enforces compliance through threat
            of imprisonment and violence. Voluntaryists
            reject the state's claimed legitimacy while
            acknowledging its factual power.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Authority</h4>
          <p>
            The supposed “right to rule.” Authority can exist over property, such as a home-owner has over their home, or an individual has over themselves, but authority cannot exist over others.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Ethical Principles</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Non-Aggression Principle (NAP)</h4>
          <p>
            The principle that no person or group may
            initiate force or fraud against another person
            or their property. The NAP permits defensive
            force but prohibits aggressive/initiated force. This is
            the foundational ethical principle of
            voluntaryism. Note: The NAP doesn't prohibit all
            force—only the <em>initiation</em> of force.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Self-Defense Principle (SDP)</h4>
          <p>
            The principle that individuals have the right to
            defend themselves, their property, and others
            against aggression using defensive force.
            Self-defense is not aggression—it's a response
            to aggression. The SDP recognizes your right to use force in resistance to
            state coercion.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Principle of Restitution (PoR)</h4>
          <p>
            The principle that justice requires making
            victims whole rather than punishing aggressors.
            When someone is harmed, the aggressor should
            provide restitution (compensation) to the
            victim. This contrasts with state "justice"
            which punishes but rarely compensates victims.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Self-Ownership</h4>
          <p>
            The principle that each individual owns
            themselves—their body, mind, and labor.
            Self-ownership is the foundation of all other
            rights. You possess the highest claim of
            authority over yourself; no one else can
            legitimately claim ownership of you or the
            fruits of your labor. See
            <a href="3_IntroVoluntaryism.html"
              >Intro to Voluntaryism</a
            >.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Property Rights</h4>
          <p>
            The concept that individuals can rightfully
            claim exclusive use and control of scarce
            resources through homesteading (first use),
            voluntary exchange, or creation. The word proper-ty (the prefix ‘proper’ meaning rightful, paired with the suffix ‘ty’ denoting the quality or state of) alludes to this.  Property rights
            exist to reduce conflict over scarce resources.
            Property is acquired without
            violating the NAP. See
            <a href="3_IntroVoluntaryism.html"
              >Intro to Voluntaryism</a
            >.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Criteria for Consent</h4>
          <p>
            For consent to exist, it must be
            <strong>revocable</strong> at any time,
            <strong>voluntary</strong> (given of free will,
            not under duress), and
            <strong>informed</strong>. Explicit dissent
            always overrides implicit consent, and any
            fraudulent basis for an agreement negates
            consent entirely.
          </p>

      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Social Organization</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Voluntary Pluralism</h4>
          <p>
            A condition where multiple different social
            systems, rules, and communities coexist
            peacefully through voluntary association. In a
            pluralist society, you're free to join
            communities with different norms—religious,
            secular, communal, individualist—as long as all
            participation is voluntary. See
            <a href="3_IntroVoluntaryism.html"
              >Intro to Voluntaryism</a
            >.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Polycentric Law</h4>
          <p>
            A legal system with multiple competing sources
            of law and arbitration rather than a single
            monopoly court system. Under polycentric law,
            individuals choose which arbitration services to
            use, creating market competition in justice
            provision. Historical examples include medieval
            Iceland and Ireland.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Customary Law</h4>
          <p>
            Law that emerges organically from community
            practice and custom rather than being imposed by
            legislators. Customary law evolves through
            precedent, arbitration, and voluntary
            acceptance. Examples include Xeer (Somalia),
            Brehon Law (Ireland), and merchant law. See
            <a href="3_examples.html">Anarchy Examples</a>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Free Association</h4>
          <p>
            The right to choose with whom you associate,
            trade, and interact. Free association means you
            can join or leave communities, accept or reject
            offers, and choose your relationships without
            coercion. This also includes the right not to
            associate—to exclude others from your property.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Consensus</h4>
          <p>
            Decision-making requiring agreement from all
            affected parties. Consensus doesn't mean
            unanimity on every detail—it means no one is
            forced to participate in arrangements they
            reject. In voluntary societies, you join
            communities that reach decisions in ways you
            accept, or you leave.
          </p>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Economic Concepts</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Free Market</h4>
          <p>
            Economic exchange free from coercion,
            regulation, taxation, or other forms of state interference. In a free
            market, all exchanges are voluntary, prices are
            determined by supply and demand, and entries/exits
            are unrestricted. What we have today is
            <em>not</em> a free market—it's a heavily
            regulated, state-controlled economy.
          </p>
        </div>


        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Parallel Economy</h4>
          <p>
            The network of economic activity operating
            outside state systems—counter-economic markets,
            voluntary insurance, private arbitration,
            community security, etc. The parallel economy
            provides alternatives to state services through
            voluntary exchange. Building the parallel
            economy is the core strategy of agorism.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Taxation</h4>
          <p>
            Coercive extraction of resources by the state
            under threat of imprisonment or violence.
            Taxation differs from voluntary payment—you
            cannot opt out without penalty. Voluntaryists
            consider taxation a form of theft regardless of
            how the funds are used or whether a majority
            voted for it.  Voting attempts to manufacture consent where it doesn't exist.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Mutual Aid</h4>
          <p>
            Voluntary cooperation for mutual benefit,
            typically in communities or associations. Mutual
            aid includes voluntary insurance pools,
            community defense, cooperative childcare, food
            sharing, and other forms of reciprocal support.
            Mutual aid is not charity—it's exchange of
            support over time.

        <h2>Network-Specific Terms</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>The Network</h4>
          <p>
            The decentralized ecosystem of voluntaryists,
            agorists, and freedom-seekers building
            alternatives to state systems. The Network
            includes market participants, hosts, guilds,
            caravans, and individuals working to create
            a voluntary society. This is not a centralized organization with
            leaders, but rather a distributed web of voluntary
            relationships.

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Agora</h4>
          <p>
            Originally the ancient Greek marketplace. In our

          <h4>Directionality</h4>
          <p>
            A philosophy of action-oriented decision-making.
            Rather than seeking only absolute truth or perfect
            knowledge, directionality asks: "Does the answer
            to this question change how I'll act?" Focus on
            conclusions that lead to meaningful action
            toward your goals. See

          <h4>Abundance Loops</h4>
          <p>
            Economic and social patterns where prosperity
            generates more prosperity through voluntary
            exchange. Creating abundance loops means
            designing your activities so success benefits
            both you and others in the Network, creating
            positive feedback that grows wealth
            collectively. See

          <h4>Keeping It in the Family</h4>
          <p>
            The strategy of directing resources to Network
            members rather than allowing wealth to bleed
            back into state systems. When you trade with
            fellow agorists, wealth stays in the parallel
            economy and funds freedom rather than tyranny.
            Prioritize doing business with those actively
            building voluntary alternatives.

          <h4>Security Mesh</h4>
          <p>
            Decentralized, community-based security achieved
            through multiple overlapping protection methods
            rather than a single police force. The security
            mesh includes private protection services,
            neighborhood watch, armed self-defense, and
            social pressure. No single point of failure. See

          <h4>Economic Secession</h4>
          <p>
            Withdrawing participation from state-controlled
            markets and systems. Economic secession means
            earning, spending, and saving outside state
            surveillance and taxation—using cash, gold, silver,
            cryptocurrency, barter, and grey market
            services. The core practice of
            counter-economics.

        <h2>Common Misunderstandings</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>"Anarchy is chaos"</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>False.</strong> Anarchy is order without
            imposed authority. Chaos is
            <em>dis</em>order—breakdown of social
            organization. Anarchist societies throughout
            history have been highly ordered through
            customary law, voluntary cooperation, and mutual
            aid. What we call "chaos" is often the violent
            transition between state systems. See
            <a href="3_examples.html">Anarchy Examples</a>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>"Voluntaryism means no rules"</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>False.</strong> Voluntaryism means no
            <em>rulers</em>, not no rules. Voluntary
            communities can have extensive rules—but all
            members consent to those rules by choosing to
            join. The difference is choice: you can leave
            and join a community with different rules. No
            one forces you to participate in arrangements
            you reject.  The reason the statist trope "if you don't like it, you can leave" is invalid and differs from what we're discussing here, is because the State doesn't actually own or have any valid claim of authority over the spaces it imposes its rules over.  Rather, the State rules through compulsion.

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>"The NAP prohibits all force"</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>False.</strong> The NAP prohibits the
            <em>initiation</em> of force, not defensive
            force. Self-defense, defense of others, and
            enforcement of contracts through agreed
            arbitration are all consistent with the NAP.
            What's prohibited is aggressive force—attacking
            people or property that haven't aggressed
            against you.

          <h4>
            "Agorism requires hiding from authorities"
          </h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Partially false.</strong> While some
            counter-economic activity must be discreet
            (black markets), much of it can operate openly
            in grey markets. Agorism isn't primarily about
            hiding—it's about building visible alternatives
            that make the state irrelevant. Many agorist
            businesses operate publicly while minimizing
            state involvement.

            "This only works for individuals, not
            communities"
          </h4>
          <p>
            <strong>False.</strong> Historical examples
            prove voluntary organization scales to large
            communities. Medieval Iceland's Commonwealth
            lasted over 300 years with 50,000+ people. The
            challenge isn't scale—it's maintaining voluntary
            principles as communities grow. See
