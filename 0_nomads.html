			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Is This Legal?</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>Living nomadically and trading your services? Completely legal.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The legal considerations:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Living in your vehicle:</strong> Legal on public lands (BLM, National Forests) and with permission on private property</li>
						<li><strong>Trading services:</strong> Legal in cash, crypto, or barter</li>
						<li><strong>Tax reporting:</strong> Personal decision based on your income level and risk tolerance</li>
						<li><strong>Business licenses:</strong> Many nomads operate without them; you decide</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<em>We're not lawyers. We're nomads sharing information about how we actually live. Research your local laws and make informed choices.</em>
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>How It Works for Nomads</h2>
				</div>

				<div
					class="callout">
					<h3>
						Step 1: Post Your Services
					</h3>
					<p>
						List what you offer and where you'll
						be on the Bounty Board. No fees, no
						approval process, no middleman
						taking a cut. Customers contact you
						directly.
					</p>
					<a
						href="6_bountyboard.html"
						class="button button2"
						>Post a Bounty</a
					>
				</div>

				<div
					class="callout">
					<h3>
						Step 2: Attend Festivals
					</h3>
					<p>
						Meet dozens of potential customers
						face-to-face at our festival
						circuit. Showcase your work, build
						relationships, and make sales. These
						aren't just markets where
						community happens.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Upcoming Events:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							 <strong>Porcfest</strong> -
							Lancaster, NH - June 17-23, 2025

				</div>

				<div
					class="callout">
					<h3>
						Step 3: Join Guilds
					</h3>
					<p>
						Connect with others in your trade.
						Learn new skills, teach what you
						know, and collaborate on bigger
						projects. From mobile mechanics to
						digital nomads, there's a guild for
						you.

					<h3>
						Step 4: Build Your Network
					</h3>
					<p>
						Get referrals from other nomads.
						Access land and resources. Find
						backup when you're stuck. This isn't
						just a marketplace a mutual aid
						network that has your back.

					<h2>What Does Nomad Life Actually Cost?</h2>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					One of the first questions people ask: "Can I afford this?" Here are realistic monthly budgets based on actual nomad experiences in the network.
				</p>
				
				<div class="overview-flex">
					<div class="overview-text">
						<h3>Minimum Budget (Bare Bones)</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Gas/Travel:</strong> $200-400/month</li>
							<li><strong>Food:</strong> $200-300/month</li>
							<li><strong>Phone/Internet:</strong> $50-100/month</li>
							<li><strong>Occasional camping fees:</strong> $50-100/month</li>
							<li><strong>Vehicle maintenance fund:</strong> $100-200/month</li>
							<li><strong>TOTAL: $600-1,100/month</strong></li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							This is survival mode—mostly free camping, cooking all meals, minimal travel. Doable, but tight.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="overview-text">
						<h3>Comfortable Budget</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Gas/Travel:</strong> $400-600/month</li>

							<li><strong>TOTAL: $1,400-2,150/month</strong></li>

						<p>
							Room to breathe—occasional paid camping, eating out sometimes, building emergency fund. Sustainable long-term.

					<h3>How Nomads Actually Earn This</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>💼 <strong>Festival sales:</strong> $500-2,500 per event (3-7 day festivals)</li>
						<li>🔧 <strong>Mobile services:</strong> $50-150/hour (mechanics, repair, etc.)</li>
						<li>💻 <strong>Remote work:</strong> $1,000-3,000/month (freelance, digital services)</li>
						<li>🎨 <strong>Craft sales:</strong> $300-1,200/month (consistent customers via bounty board)</li>
						<li>🤝 <strong>Mixed approach:</strong> Most nomads combine 2-3 income streams</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					These are estimates based on network members' real expenses. Your costs depend on travel frequency, vehicle type, and lifestyle choices. Many nomads earn while traveling through festivals and the bounty board, making this financially sustainable.

			<!-- NOMAD LIFE CHALLENGES -->
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>The Hard Parts Nobody Talks About</h2>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					Van life influencers show sunsets and adventure. Here's what they don't show: the real challenges of nomadic living.
				</p>
				
				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Reality #1: Breakdowns Destroy Your Budget</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>"Transmission died 800 miles from anywhere. $3,500 repair wiped out 4 months of savings. Took 6 months to recover."</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The lesson:</strong> Vehicle maintenance fund isn't optional. Budget $200-300/month minimum. When (not if) something major breaks, you need reserves. Consider AAA Plus or similar.
					</p>
					<p><em>— Chris, 31, Full-time nomad</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Reality #2: Weather Can Trap You</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>"Got stuck in Arizona summer with no AC. 115°F inside the van. Couldn't work, couldn't sleep. Lost 2 weeks of income finding somewhere cooler."</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The lesson:</strong> You're at weather's mercy. Follow the seasons or have climate control. Budget for unexpected location changes. Summer/winter can cost you money if you're in the wrong place.
					</p>
					<p><em>— Sarah, 28, Seasonal nomad</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Reality #3: Loneliness Hits Different on the Road</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>"Freedom is great until you realize you haven't had a real conversation in 3 weeks. No close friends nearby. Family 2,000 miles away. It gets dark."</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The lesson:</strong> Nomad life can be isolating. Network connections become critical. Join caravans, attend meetups, don't just chase pretty locations. Community > scenery for mental health.
					</p>
					<p><em>— Alex, 35, Solo nomad</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Reality #4: Finding Good Camping Gets Harder</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>"Free camping spots that used to be easy are now crowded, posted, or shut down. Spent whole days just looking for legal places to sleep."</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The lesson:</strong> Van life popularity has consequences. Have backup plans. Network host locations become essential. Budget for occasional paid camping. Apps like FreeRoam/iOverlander help but aren't perfect.
					</p>
					<p><em>— Jordan, 40, 3 years on road</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Reality #5: It's Harder With Partners/Kids</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>"Solo van life was manageable. Add a partner with different temperature preferences, sleep schedules, and need for space? Constant tension."</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The lesson:</strong> Relationships get tested in 60 square feet. Kids make it exponentially harder (schooling, healthcare, safety). Be realistic about whether your situation can handle it. Many successful nomads are solo.
					</p>
					<p><em>— Taylor, 33, Went back to stationary living</em></p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<!-- NOMAD LIFE ISN'T FOR EVERYONE -->
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="callout">
					<h3>When Nomad Life Doesn't Work</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>About 30-40% of people who try full-time nomad life quit within the first year.</strong> Common reasons:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Vehicle problems exceeded budget/tolerance</li>
						<li>Loneliness became unbearable</li>
						<li>Partner/relationship couldn't handle the stress</li>
						<li>Health issues made mobile life untenable</li>
						<li>Realized they need more routine/stability</li>
						<li>Couldn't maintain income while traveling</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<strong>This doesn't make nomad life "bad"—it makes it selective.</strong> The people who thrive long-term are usually:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>✅ Mechanically competent (or learn fast)</li>
						<li>✅ Comfortable with uncertainty</li>
						<li>✅ Good at making quick friendships</li>
						<li>✅ Minimalists by nature</li>
						<li>✅ Have reliable remote income OR love festival work</li>
						<li>✅ Actually enjoy constant change</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Try it before you sell everything. Rent an RV for a month. Try vehicle dwelling for a summer. Test if you actually like it before committing.
