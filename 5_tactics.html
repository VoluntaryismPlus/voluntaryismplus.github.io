        <h3>Strategies for Economic Freedom</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond understanding why agorism works, this page
          provides the actionable strategies and practical
          tools to build a thriving parallel economy. Here,
          you will discover concrete methods for engaging in
          counter-economic activities, diversifying your
          trade, and directly contributing to the economic
          freedom that defunds coercive systems.

            <em>Interaction Receipts</em>
          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Receipts are proof of interactions that have taken
          place. A receipt could be created by any
          interaction between two people, but the quality of
          the receipt is determined by its vision and scope.
          Those involved in the interaction will sign off on
          a description of what took place during this
          interaction and can add more context in the future
          upon the agreement of both parties. Work that is
          completed can use an hourly or interaction
          receipt. It fulfills certain requirements in the
          moment, but can also be expanded upon in the
          future. For example, by being present again and
          again, and gaining a receipt for each instance,
          you build trust in others that you will be present
          more in the future. Receipts do not go away. The
          achievements they detail usually only get expanded
          upon, unless there is a dispute. If you&rsquo;re
          working towards a career, you can build receipts
          that will count simultaneously towards many things
          in the future.

          People value knowing there is a safety net for the
          poor. Both for people they care about, people who
          might otherwise hurt them, or for their own sake
          if they do see a potential for misfortune. The
          problem is, we all know how easy it would be to
          solve the issue of homelessness but doing that is
          often expensive or illegal. We need connections
          and strength to get more connections and strength.
          Supply and demand will not provide the market
          quickly enough until we provide more goods at a
          cheaper time. We also understand that the stress
          of high rent and mortgages makes it hard and that
          is why we are providing affordable housing and
          jobs that pay more due to not going through the
          system.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Crowdfunding can purchase properties to be divided
          up and can purchase properties that will be used
          by people who don't currently desire to own their
          own plots. Similarly, equipment to meet farming or
          housing needs can be funded like a CSA - you pay
          upfront and then get your money back and then some
          when the product is finished.

        <p>
          So many of the best people are hidden away from
          outsiders, or hiding from their own morals by
          producing wealth and intel for the state. There
          are real reasons for any person in this era to
          fear retribution from the state if they do
          business outside of the regulatory and
          &ldquo;tax&rdquo; or extortion system.
          That&rsquo;s why we need to start offering an
          alternative option for people to choose that
          doesn&rsquo;t single them out individually but
          instead provides logical reasons to feel secure
          against the threat of the state.
        </p>
        <p>
          When there is no network strong enough to support
          someone they are less likely to take actions they
          see as dangerous. Similarly, when there is no
          certainty that there will be a market for
          someone&rsquo;s farm goods, they won&rsquo;t
          necessarily have the resources to expand for the
          risk of having food they can&rsquo;t sell.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The same issue arises for consumers of agorist
          goods. Agorist goods are always cheaper on the
          conscious than those that fund extortion, but that
          does not mean they are cheap enough for many to
          afford in day-to-day life. Additionally, agorist
          consumers do not find the supply for their own
          needs to be consistent, varied, or crowd-tested.
          There can be a lack of options that leads to an
          unfair market price.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are filling in that gap in supply with
          dedication and our own manpower. More importantly,
          the gap is being filled by local people in their
          own communities. We are simply enabling those
          interactions. There is much more wealth to be
          grown in our network than is currently being
          distributed within it. If the demand is no longer
          there for local goods in an area, that should not
          restrict someone from growing a crop or offering
          something. The caravan and individual people will
          fill in the network just as semi trucks do today
          for larger companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of supply and demand implies that in a
          free market, producers will produce goods they can
          sell for profit. But if there aren&rsquo;t enough
          customers for a product and not enough publicity,
          the producer will have no reason to try and
          provide goods for a market there. Just as someone
          would desire a carbon tax upon behaviors that
          could damage the environment, we are advocating a
          &ldquo;government footprint statistic&rdquo; to be
          observed and self-regulated among our associates.

          The last thing freedom-oriented individuals need
          is to think they have to work 8-hour days at a
          business that is not doing anything to create
          anarchy in this lifetime, right now. When we meet
          an anarchist, we don&rsquo;t try to direct them
          towards labor but towards intellectual
          understandings of how to create anarchy in this
          lifetime. Wealth gained is more useful when it is
          not being bled out towards the state.

          Have more than you can sell? Having difficulty
          finding customers? If your goal at any given
          moment is to gain a store of value such as gold,
          silver, or cash from a potential customer, then
          you must have something they are willing to trade
          you for. The larger your variety of agorist
          products, the higher your chance is that
          you&rsquo;ll have a product someone you encounter
          will want.

        <p>
          When attempting to sell cannabis wax on the
          streets of Oakland, my prospective customers would
          inform me of the products they would be willing to
          trade for if not the wax I had available. Many
          would ask for flower, or some other substance of
          preference I didn&rsquo;t have to offer - and I
          missed the sale as a result. My goal was to
          support the grey and black market by offering
          products produced and sold by individuals seeking
          to be free from extortion and regulation, but I
          lacked sufficient variety to sell more than the
          one product I had available.

        <p>
          If you already have an established network of
          trade and barter and the products you trade have a
          long-term store-of-value sufficient to easily sell
          the product before it loses value, then you can
          &ldquo;front&rdquo; (give a portion of your
          product to someone you trust, usually at a
          discounted rate, in exchange for a portion of
          theirs. In this way, you both have more products
          to offer customers, and you are able to sell
          one-another&rsquo;s goods in a variety of untapped
          markets. The power this affords participants
          (traders) is to make them into economic
          power-houses, far more capable than your average
          person at getting wealth from a given passer-by in
          exchange for a good.

          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Buying items from a statist using gold or silver
          places them in a unique position: they now possess
          a form of wealth that they are highly unlikely to
          ever report to or surrender to the State. Because
          precious metals operate outside traditional fiat
          systems and are inherently private, accepting them
          subtly pulls individuals into the parallel
          economy. In effect, by engaging in such a
          transaction, you transform a statist into an
          unwitting economic agorist, contributing to the
          growth of a decentralized, freedom-oriented
          market, one transaction at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tactic doesn't require any explicit
          ideological conversion; it simply leverages the
          universal desire for real wealth and security. As
          more individuals experience the tangible benefits
          and privacy of using sound money, their reliance
          on and trust in the State's inflationary currency
          naturally diminishes. Each direct exchange of
          value outside the State's purview strengthens the
          parallel economy, paving the way for greater
          individual autonomy and market freedom.

          Canning, Dehydrating, Freeze-drying, root cellars,

          If I have more freezer space, I am able to accept
          and preserve a wider variety of consumable and
          sellable items. If a customer has more freezer
          space, they are more able to accept a larger
          amount of beef (for example), which ultimately
          saves them a lot of money. Morgan and I, for
          example, don&rsquo;t consider ourselves able to
          afford to purchase beef in quantities less than
          1/4 or 1/2 a cow because we now have the freezer
          space to store it, so we can always buy our meat
          in bulk which affords us both personal nutrition
          and a constant product we make available for trade

          We support people in translating their lifestyle
          away from the tax system and into the network. In
          order to fully detach, you must reclaim your
          income, housing, business and expenditures. There
          are many resources on this site to help you
          transition into a new life. You can start

          or keep reading to get the full picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are not ready to transition in one or more
          of these areas, you can still spread freedom where
          you are by employing the following strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also applies to individuals who do not want
          to leave their current area but still wants to
          grow the network around them.

            <h4>Freedom Through Goods and Services</h4>
            <p>
              If you want to spread freedom in your area,
              start by identifying a need people have for a
              good or service and find someone who is
              willing to meet that need. Work with that
              person to create a model where they are able
              to produce a good or provide a service at a
              cost and value that is comparable to the
              market rate but without funding or complying
              with the state in any way.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>Freedom Through Housing</h4>
            <p>
              Find ways of circumventing the state through
              providing tax-free shelter for those who are
              also actively trying to create and grow the
              network. The easiest way to do this is to
              create a caravan outside of a city or town
              where the caravan members support each other
              in taking advantage of the amenities of the
              city or town. Members can earn income remotely
              or through interactions with the people of the
              town.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also create an
              <a href="“7.5_Innercity.html”">inner-city</a>
              or
              <a href="“7.4_Outercity.html”"
                >outer-city outpost</a
              >
              to support visiting caravans and provide a way
              out for people still stuck in the system.
            </p>
            <p>
              A third option would be to become a
              <a href="2.2_NetworkHosts.html"
                >Network Host</a
              >
              and help those trying to gain a new position
              in the network.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>Grow Your Network</h4>
            <p>
              The most effective way to grow your network is
              to find people both local and remote to
              collaborate with on creating new offerings in
              the network.
            </p>
            <p>

              To source new contacts in your area, spread
              word of the network with those you meet.
              Identify others who are looking for ways to be
              more free. This includes both friends in
              freedom and trusted individuals who are both
              trade and social contacts.

              You can also create meetups and marketspaces
              to discuss options, form and execute plans,
              and conduct trade with those who attend. If
              nomadic, such spaces should be created when
              possible, or you can locate a preexisting
              space near you to make contact and trade with
              others in the network. If stationary, the aim
              is to have a regular network meeting and
              market space available near you.
