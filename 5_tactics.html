                        <em>Interaction Receipts</em>

                <p>
                    Receipts are proof of interactions that
                    have taken place. A receipt could be
                    created by any interaction between two
                    people, but the quality of the receipt
                    is determined by its vision and scope.
                    Those involved in the interaction will
                    sign off on a description of what took
                    place during this interaction and can
                    add more context in the future upon the
                    agreement of both parties. Work that is
                    completed can use an hourly or
                    interaction receipt. It fulfills certain
                    requirements in the moment, but can also
                    be expanded upon in the future. For
                    example, by being present again and
                    again, and gaining a receipt for each
                    instance, you build trust in others that
                    you will be present more in the future.
                    Receipts do not go away. The
                    achievements they detail usually only
                    get expanded upon, unless there is a
                    dispute. If you&rsquo;re working towards
                    a career, you can build receipts that
                    will count simultaneously towards many
                    things in the future.

                    People value knowing there is a safety
                    net for the poor. Both for people they
                    care about, people who might otherwise
                    hurt them, or for their own sake if they
                    do see a potential for misfortune. The
                    problem is, we all know how easy it
                    would be to solve the issue of
                    homelessness but doing that is often
                    expensive or illegal. We need
                    connections and strength to get more
                    connections and strength. Supply and
                    demand will not provide the market
                    quickly enough until we provide more
                    goods at a cheaper time. We also
                    understand that the stress of high rent
                    and mortgages makes it hard and that is
                    why we are providing affordable housing
                    and jobs that pay more due to not going
                    through the system.&nbsp;

                    Crowdfunding can purchase properties to
                    be divided up and can purchase
                    properties that will be used by people
                    who don't currently desire to own their
                    own plots. Similarly, equipment to meet
                    farming or housing needs can be funded
                    like a CSA - you pay upfront and then
                    get your money back and then some when
                    the product is finished.

                    So many of the best people are hidden
                    away from outsiders, or hiding from
                    their own morals by producing wealth and
                    intel for the state. There are real
                    reasons for any person in this era to
                    fear retribution from the state if they
                    do business outside of the regulatory
                    and &ldquo;tax&rdquo; or extortion
                    system. That&rsquo;s why we need to
                    start offering an alternative option for
                    people to choose that doesn&rsquo;t
                    single them out individually but instead
                    provides logical reasons to feel secure
                    against the threat of the state.

                    When there is no network strong enough
                    to support someone they are less likely
                    to take actions they see as dangerous.
                    Similarly, when there is no certainty
                    that there will be a market for
                    someone&rsquo;s farm goods, they
                    won&rsquo;t necessarily have the
                    resources to expand for the risk of
                    having food they can&rsquo;t sell.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The same issue arises for consumers of
                    agorist goods. Agorist goods are always
                    cheaper on the conscious than those that
                    fund extortion, but that does not mean
                    they are cheap enough for many to afford
                    in day-to-day life. Additionally,
                    agorist consumers do not find the supply
                    for their own needs to be consistent,
                    varied, or crowd-tested. There can be a
                    lack of options that leads to an unfair
                    market price.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are filling in that gap in supply
                    with dedication and our own manpower.
                    More importantly, the gap is being
                    filled by local people in their own
                    communities. We are simply enabling
                    those interactions. There is much more
                    wealth to be grown in our network than
                    is currently being distributed within
                    it. If the demand is no longer there for
                    local goods in an area, that should not
                    restrict someone from growing a crop or
                    offering something. The caravan and
                    individual people will fill in the
                    network just as semi trucks do today for
                    larger companies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept of supply and demand implies
                    that in a free market, producers will
                    produce goods they can sell for profit.
                    But if there aren&rsquo;t enough
                    customers for a product and not enough
                    publicity, the producer will have no
                    reason to try and provide goods for a
                    market there. Just as someone would
                    desire a carbon tax upon behaviors that
                    could damage the environment, we are
                    advocating a &ldquo;government footprint
                    statistic&rdquo; to be observed and
                    self-regulated among our associates.

                    The last thing freedom-oriented
                    individuals need is to think they have
                    to work 8-hour days at a business that
                    is not doing anything to create anarchy
                    in this lifetime, right now. When we
                    meet an anarchist, we don&rsquo;t try to
                    direct them towards labor but towards
                    intellectual understandings of how to
                    create anarchy in this lifetime. Wealth
                    gained is more useful when it is not
                    being bled out towards the state.

                    When attempting to sell cannabis wax on
                    the streets of Oakland, my prospective
                    customers would inform me of the
                    products they would be willing to trade
                    for if not the wax I had available. Many
                    would ask for flower, or some other
                    substance of preference I didn&rsquo;t
                    have to offer - and I missed the sale as

                    products produced and sold by
                    individuals seeking to be free from
                    extortion and regulation, but I lacked
                    sufficient variety to sell more than the
                    one product I had available.

                    If you already have an established
                    network of trade and barter and the
                    products you trade have a long-term
                    store-of-value sufficient to easily sell
                    the product before it loses value, then
                    you can &ldquo;front&rdquo; (give a
                    portion of your product to someone you
                    trust, usually at a discounted rate, in
                    exchange for a portion of theirs. In
                    this way, you both have more products to
                    offer customers, and you are able to
                    sell one-another&rsquo;s goods in a
                    variety of untapped markets. The power

                    If I have more freezer space, I am able
                    to accept and preserve a wider variety
                    of consumable and sellable items. If a
                    customer has more freezer space, they
                    are more able to accept a larger amount
                    of beef (for example), which ultimately
                    saves them a lot of money. Morgan and I,
                    for example, don&rsquo;t consider
                    ourselves able to afford to purchase
                    beef in quantities less than 1/4 or 1/2
                    a cow because we now have the freezer
                    space to store it, so we can always buy
                    our meat in bulk which affords us both
                    personal nutrition and a constant
                    product we make available for trade to
                    others.

                    We support people in translating their
                    lifestyle away from the tax system and
                    into the network. In order to fully
                    detach, you must reclaim your income,
                    housing, business and expenditures.
                    There are many resources on this site to
                    help you transition into a new life. You

                            willing to meet that need. Work
                            with that person to create a

                            Find ways of circumventing the
                            state through providing tax-free
                            shelter for those who are also

                            grow the network. The easiest
                            way to do this is to create a
                            caravan outside of a city or
                            town where the caravan members
                            support each other in taking
                            advantage of the amenities of
                            the city or town. Members can
                            earn income remotely or through
                            interactions with the people of
                            the town.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can also create an
                            <a href="“7.5_Innercity.html”"
                                >inner-city</a

                            to support visiting caravans and

                            The most effective way to grow
                            your network is to find people
                            both local and remote to
                            collaborate with on creating new
                            offerings in the network.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To find these contacts, you can
                            search within the network via
                            the options on this page:<br />

                            To source new contacts in your
                            area, spread word of the network
                            with those you meet. Identify
                            others who are looking for ways
                            to be more free. This includes
                            both friends in freedom and
                            trusted individuals who are both
                            trade and social contacts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can also create meetups and
                            marketspaces to discuss options,
                            form and execute plans, and
                            conduct trade with those who
                            attend. If nomadic, such spaces
                            should be created when possible,
                            or you can locate a preexisting
                            space near you to make contact
                            and trade with others in the
                            network. If stationary, the aim
                            is to have a regular network
                            meeting and market space
                            available near you.
