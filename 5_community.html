			<h1>Community</h1>

			<div class="innersection">
				<p>
					You've explored the philosophy in The Library. You've examined the tools and strategies in The Workshop. Now comes the most crucial part: putting it all into practice. Welcome to Community—where theory becomes action, where isolated individuals become interconnected networks, and where the abstract principle of voluntary association manifests in daily life.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is not another lecture hall. This is the place where adventurers gather—people who have decided to stop simply learning about freedom and start living it. Here, you'll find the interpersonal skills, conflict resolution strategies, and community-building wisdom necessary to navigate the complex social landscape of creating a free society.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>What You'll Find in Community</h2>
				<p>
					The Community section contains two essential components for building voluntary networks:
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h3>Community Building Skills</h3>
				<p>
					Before you can build community, you must master the fundamentals of authentic human connection within a voluntaryist framework. These pages equip you with the skills to:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Build genuine relationships</strong> that honor autonomy while fostering interdependence</li>
						<li><strong>Navigate groups</strong> without compromising your principles or losing yourself</li>
						<li><strong>Spread ideas of freedom</strong> effectively without being preachy or alienating</li>
						<li><strong>Resolve conflicts</strong> and deal with bad actors without resorting to coercion</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<h4>The Journey Through Community Building:</h4>
				<div class="callout">
					<p><strong><a href="5_failure.html">Why Communities Fail</a></strong></p>
					<p>Understanding failure patterns helps you avoid repeating history's mistakes. Learn from intentional communities that dissolved, cooperatives that collapsed, and voluntary associations that fractured—so you can build structures that endure.</p>
					
					<p><strong><a href="5_authentic.html">Building Authentic Relationships</a></strong></p>
					<p>Master the art of genuine connection based on voluntary association and mutual value. Discover how to set boundaries, balance community with individualism, avoid toxic politeness, and create relationships that strengthen rather than drain you.</p>
					
					<p><strong><a href="5_groups.html">Navigating Groups & Networks</a></strong></p>
					<p>Learn the practical skills of engaging with existing communities and organizations. How do you enter a new group without compromising principles? When should you deepen involvement versus gracefully exit? How do you become a bridge between networks?</p>
					
					<p><strong><a href="5_spreading.html">Spreading Freedom</a></strong></p>
					<p>Discover the art of helping others discover voluntaryism. What triggers the "wake-up moment"? Which questions spark genuine curiosity? How do you meet people where they are and guide them toward greater freedom without being preachy or alienating?</p>
					
					<p><strong><a href="5_conflict.html">Conflict Resolution & Boundaries</a></strong></p>
					<p>Address the elephant in the room: "What about bad actors?" Learn how voluntary communities handle conflict, maintain boundaries, deal with violence and fraud, and create justice that actually serves victims—all without the state's coercive monopoly.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h3>Connection Tools</h3>
				<p>
					Beyond interpersonal skills, you need practical tools for finding people and facilitating difficult conversations:
				</p>

				<div class="book">
					<div class="bookheader">
						<h4><a href="5_directory.html">Network Directory <span class="book-arrow">→</span></a></h4>
					</div>
					<p>
						Your comprehensive guide to finding people, resources, services, and opportunities within the network. The Directory explains how to connect through online forums, in-person events, collaboration boards, and local meetups. This is where you discover who does what, where they are, and how to reach them.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="book">
					<div class="bookheader">
						<h4><a href="5_consensual.html">Consensual Conversation Table <span class="book-arrow">→</span></a></h4>
					</div>
					<p>
						A structured framework for difficult dialogues. When conversations risk becoming heated or unproductive, the Consensual Conversation Table provides tools for genuine mutual understanding across differences. Essential for resolving disputes and maintaining healthy community dynamics.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Why This Section Matters</h2>
				<p>
					Many people understand voluntaryist philosophy intellectually but struggle to apply it in daily life. They know taxation is theft, but they still file their taxes. They recognize government as illegitimate, but they don't know how to build alternatives. They want community, but every intentional community they've seen has failed or turned cult-like.
				</p>
				<p>
					Community bridges that gap between theory and practice. It provides the social technology—the proven methods, the learned wisdom, the practical skills—that allows abstract principles to manifest as concrete freedom.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>How to Use This Section</h2>
				<h3>If You're New to Practical Voluntaryism:</h3>
				<p>
					Start with the Community Building pages in order. Each builds on the previous. Understanding why communities fail helps you build better relationships. Building authentic relationships prepares you to navigate groups. Group navigation skills enable effective outreach. And outreach inevitably leads to conflicts that must be resolved justly.
				</p>

				<h3>If You're Actively Building:</h3>
				<p>
					Jump to what you need. Facing a difficult situation with a new group? Read Navigating Groups. Trying to wake someone up? Spreading Freedom. Dealing with a bad actor? Conflict Resolution. Looking for collaborators? Check the Network Directory.
				</p>

				<h3>If You're Already Experienced:</h3>
				<p>
					We've attempted to distill decades of intentional community failures, voluntary organization successes, and network-building experiences into these pages. Even if you're seasoned, you may find new perspectives, alternative approaches, or validation for what you already knew intuitively. And please—share your own experiences with us so we can continue improving this resource.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>The Adventure Begins</h2>
				<p>
					An adventurer is someone who leaves the safety of the known to explore the possible. In our context, that means leaving the false security of the state system to build voluntary alternatives. It's not without risk—but what great endeavor is?
				</p>
				<p>
					The good news: you're not alone. Thousands are on this same journey. Community is where we share maps, warn of dangers, celebrate victories, and encourage each other forward.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every relationship you build on voluntaryist principles is a victory. Every group you successfully navigate without compromising your values is progress. Every person you help wake up to freedom is another ally. Every conflict you resolve justly, without state violence, is proof that alternatives work.
				</p>
				<p>
					Small actions, multiplied across enough people, become unstoppable movements. Your adventure—your daily choices to associate voluntarily, to reject coercion, to build alternatives—is part of something much larger. Welcome to the Community section where those adventures begin.
				</p>
