			<h1>Creating Healthy Communities</h1>

			<div class="innersection">
				<p>After we have funded the infrastructure to make our camp, we want to offer a daily free festival and marketplace to welcome people who don’t have hundreds of dollars to spend to attend a weekend where they won’t even make a friend because it is not big enough to support those connections.
				</p><p>There are no more open forums where people can meet and discuss things and ideas can be presented with or without flair. The open, plural market would take care of these problems. Along with regulation, better private security and many other things.</p><h2><strong>Community Health</strong></h2>
				<p>to be continued...</p>
				<p>There will be an exchange of people</p>
				<p>
					Everyone has to have an understanding of the
					larger network and the potential we have in this
					lifetime to create total anarchy
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal is to direct people away from us who are
					not working towards the ideal as fully.
				</p>
				<p>
					So they can have their own thing, but we won't be
					directing our manpower towards them
					preferentially.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this way, we direct our energy and attention
					away from those who are not trying to help others.
				</p>
				<h3><strong>Boundaries</strong></h3>
				<p>to be continued...</p>
				<p>Time and Energy Boundaries</p>
				<p>
					How many ideals do we want them to share? You can
					decide how close you allow people based on their
					values but there is only one general value we
					require and that is the non-agression principle.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is important to value the perspectives of those
					who have seen much, as they may see some risk
					others would not.
				</p>
				<p>
					We need to have people who we are bringing around
					and helping exclusively. Meaning when I give my
					mana and time to someone, I want it to be worth
					it. If my friends would accept that we could
					accept another person into our circle...
				</p>
				<p>How to join forces</p>
				<p>How to join everything together</p>
				<p>How to break through</p>
				<p>
					If you don&rsquo;t have your own life on the
					convoy, you might try to control others' lives.
					Therefore, we all have our own life. We
					don&rsquo;t look for monetary help or a customer
					in our friend or neighbor.

				<h3>
					<strong>Getting to Know Someone</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					The best way to help someone make a positive
					change as perceived by them and not your bias
					would be to get to know them as friends, and then
					figure out what they really want, and then see how
					what they're saying relates to that thing they
					want. If you're not being evil, you will come out
					successfully.
				</p>
				<p>
					The way that you can avoid the most heartache is
					to be completely honest and to both be trying to
					make sure the other gets what they deserve fully.
					And is involved in that process. In concept and in
					goal. As my friend, you want me to find the
					perfect person for myself, and that you are
					interested in understanding how that is.
				</p>
				<p>
					My conception of friendship: You have to make sure
					you know the other is a good person in your eyes.

				<p>to be continued...</p>
				<p>
					We need each other to survive and be happy. But we
					don&rsquo;t need to live so close that we&rsquo;re
					suffocating. But living too far removed from one
					another is way worse than that.
				</p>
				<p>
					It&rsquo;s good to be in contact with people
					consistently. Seeing their true nature, you can
					start honing in on the people on your side.
				</p>
				<p>
					The correct relationship between self-sufficiency
					and
				</p>
				<p>
					The first step of becoming safe with another, in
					this day and age, is being able to trust their
					usage of their phone.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;Are you addicted to your phone&rdquo; Is an
					ironic question. If you were addicted to a tool,
					you would become massively productive unless you
					misused the tool and wasted your time with it. But
					if you are asking someone this question, you are
					probably referencing a hidden, ignored reality,
					which is that the person is mousing their phone
					and their time on the planet.

				<h3>
					<strong>Why do Some Communities Fail?</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>Leaders vs dynamic groups. A lone director of a community is unlikely to be dynamic enough to satisfy the innovative urge in people.</p>
				<p>Instead, a community would be better served by a dynamic, growth oriented structure and compostion. This means a guiding structure that is able to adapt to new information and innovations depending on the people involved at the time.</p>
				<p>to be continued...</p>
				<p>What has been tried?</p>
				<p>What is bound to succeed?</p>
				<p>
					A community is bound to fail eventually if its
					building plan allows for failure. Our plan is
					resilient in these ways:
				</p>
				<p>
					It is an idea. It does not need to have a concrete
					example to be potent. Someone can pick up a book
					on it at any time and recreate what we are doing.

					"If someone thinks that reality is something it is
					not, what is that called? Cognitive dissonance?
					When you think that living on the road is
					undignified, just know that on the days I do hear
					cars scream by, or airplanes because I am visiting
					a populated area, I remind myself that I have none
					of the concerns I had when I was stationary. No
					rent to pay and no way for a person being able to
					target me based on my home address."

				<p>you need to focus on their position</p>
				<p>
					The best possible configuration is that the person
					sees and appreciates what we are trying to do for
					people, including him.
				</p>
				<p>
					If one sees the value in living free with us, he
					will see how to fit in nicely once we've talked
					more.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, the best possible way he could help
					us would be to know why we were valuable and use
					his network to get more people doing and
					supporting what our non-business model is. He
					would be helping us protect ourselves.
