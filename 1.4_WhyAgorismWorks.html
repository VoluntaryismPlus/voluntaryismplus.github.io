                    Institutions that initiate or threaten
                    to initiate force against the person or
                    property of others have no right to
                    exist. Therefore, the authority-based
                    power structures that call themselves
                    &ldquo;The State&rdquo; have no right to
                    exist. (they should not exist and are
                    not necessary for any positive paradigm
                    shifts from now on) //
                </p>
                <p>
                    These institutions would have never
                    gained power if not for murder, lies,
                    and deception. The only strategy they
                    utilize to solve problems is the use and
                    threat of violence. There is no argument
                    for authority that makes sense because
                    we are all equal in rights and none can
                    possess extra rights to do things that
                    are wrong for others to do. //For
                    something to be a moral principle, it
                    must be universally applicable. This is
                    the universal ethic axiom, otherwise
                    it&rsquo;s not really an ethic. It is
                    always wrong to initiate or threaten to
                    initiate force against the person or
                    property of other peaceful people.

                    There is a perception held by some that
                    there is little opportunity for those
                    who desire autonomy and freedom. And
                    this is both true and not true.
                    Currently, many things are in the way of
                    people doing what they would do
                    otherwise.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are laws that restrict these
                    things, and people&rsquo;s fears are
                    valid. We don&rsquo;t need people to be
                    breaking the law on their own. We need
                    to make safer decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main thing that we are not seeing in
                    the literature available today is many
                    people talking about the power that we
                    have right now as a group of millions of
                    individuals or even hundreds of
                    thousands who understand what needs to
                    be done and how easy it will be to free
                    the rest of the world from slavery by
                    government.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    We see the possibility that comes with
                    each person. There is so much more
                    possibility for each person who
                    understands the network, but when you
                    add certain constraints, you can yield
                    very potent results. Those who want to
                    participate in these constraints are
                    considered to be part of the
                    &lsquo;engine&rsquo;. For those outside
                    of the engine, there is much more we can
                    connect on (human sovereignty) than what
                    divides us.&nbsp;

                    When you begin to think in terms of the
                    real world and what is possible when
                    people are free to act as they want, you
                    can begin to see the value that would be
                    kept in the family if we made more
                    decisions that favored people who knew
                    how to direct their actions toward
                    building a strong network that will take
                    care of us when we were in trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, the network we are working
                    on opposes the idea of keeping a job
                    that funds the state when there are jobs
                    available to you that don&rsquo;t.
                    That&rsquo;s why we are working to
                    expand the number of jobs available
                    within the network that meet these
                    criteria: they do not fund the state or
                    people who fund the state. Eventually,
                    this will look like all participants in
                    all transactions not funding the state
                    with their shelter, job, food, or
                    leisure activities.

                    The confrontation: where does your
                    business lead after you have taken care
                    of your basic needs (not necessarily the
                    business needs because a business can be
                    a net negative if it is not formulated
                    properly. Basically, did your business
                    plan include an altruistic vision?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second question: Where are you
                    spending your money? Is it going towards
                    a network that will help you or towards
                    a system that will hurt you?

                <p>
                    Businesses can be human-centric. You can
                    make a product that helps people. But it
                    needs to organize itself in a dynamic,
                    fluid way. And it also needs a human. In
                    itself, a business can have built into
                    it a philosophy and methodology that
                    makes sure it does not become a negative
                    entity, but it needs humans to enforce
                    that methodology and make sure it is
                    reflective of the outside world. What is
                    the machine that is created? Can you pay
                    them in silver?

                        <em>Interaction Receipts</em>

                <p>
                    Receipts are proof of interactions that
                    have taken place. A receipt could be
                    created by any interaction between two
                    people, but the quality of the receipt
                    is determined by its vision and scope.
                    Those involved in the interaction will
                    sign off on a description of what took
                    place during this interaction and can
                    add more context in the future upon the
                    agreement of both parties. Work that is
                    completed can use an hourly or
                    interaction receipt. It fulfills certain
                    requirements in the moment, but can also
                    be expanded upon in the future. For
                    example, by being present again and
                    again, and gaining a receipt for each
                    instance, you build trust in others that
                    you will be present more in the future.
                    Receipts do not go away. The
                    achievements they detail usually only
                    get expanded upon, unless there is a
                    dispute. If you&rsquo;re working towards
                    a career, you can build receipts that
                    will count simultaneously towards many
                    things in the future.

                    People value knowing there is a safety
                    net for the poor. Both for people they
                    care about, people who might otherwise
                    hurt them, or for their own sake if they
                    do see a potential for misfortune. The
                    problem is, we all know how easy it
                    would be to solve the issue of
                    homelessness but doing that is often
                    expensive or illegal. We need
                    connections and strength to get more
                    connections and strength. Supply and
                    demand will not provide the market
                    quickly enough until we provide more
                    goods at a cheaper time. We also
                    understand that the stress of high rent
                    and mortgages makes it hard and that is
                    why we are providing affordable housing
                    and jobs that pay more due to not going
                    through the system.&nbsp;

                    like a CSA - you pay upfront and then

                    Agorist Hosts provide a particular type
                    of visit because it is also an entryway
                    into the next realm. You can choose your
                    rate of involvement. After a trial
                    period at a property, your application
                    may be accepted to join a network host

                    Network hosts agree on a set period
                    where they will open a section of their
                    property or home to a guest with the
                    intent of helping that person find a
                    better place in the network - be that
                    through finding a new living situation,
                    job, or other personal development.

                    Network hosts are not trying to get
                    labor out of individuals. Their interest
                    lies in introducing people to
                    Voluntaryism and the nonaggression
                    principle while providing them with an
                    opportunity that is consistent with what
                    they desire.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Network Host does not desire only to
                    arrange work trade situations but to
                    direct people into the network and into
                    Guilds. Network Hosts may have a
                    property they include in their hosting
                    or they may meet with people at other
                    spaces, like the caravan, etc.

                    So many of the best people are hidden
                    away from outsiders, or hiding from
                    their own morals by producing wealth and
                    intel for the state. There are real
                    reasons for any person in this era to
                    fear retribution from the state if they
                    do business outside of the regulatory
                    and &ldquo;tax&rdquo; or extortion
                    system. That&rsquo;s why we need to
                    start offering an alternative option for
                    people to choose that doesn&rsquo;t
                    single them out individually but instead
                    provides logical reasons to feel secure
                    against the threat of the state.

                    When there is no network strong enough
                    to support someone they are less likely
                    to take actions they see as dangerous.
                    Similarly, when there is no certainty
                    that there will be a market for
                    someone&rsquo;s farm goods, they
                    won&rsquo;t necessarily have the
                    resources to expand for the risk of
                    having food they can&rsquo;t sell.&nbsp;

                    The same issue arises for consumers of
                    agorist goods. Agorist goods are always
                    cheaper on the conscious than those that
                    fund extortion, but that does not mean
                    they are cheap enough for many to afford
                    in day-to-day life. Additionally,
                    agorist consumers do not find the supply
                    for their own needs to be consistent,
                    varied, or crowd-tested. There can be a
                    lack of options that leads to an unfair
                    market price.&nbsp;

                <p>
                    We are filling in that gap in supply
                    with dedication and our own manpower.
                    More importantly, the gap is being
                    filled by local people in their own
                    communities. We are simply enabling
                    those interactions. There is much more
                    wealth to be grown in our network than
                    is currently being distributed within
                    it. If the demand is no longer there for
                    local goods in an area, that should not
                    restrict someone from growing a crop or
                    offering something. The caravan and
                    individual people will fill in the
                    network just as semi trucks do today for
                    larger companies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept of supply and demand implies
                    that in a free market, producers will
                    produce goods they can sell for profit.
                    But if there aren&rsquo;t enough
                    customers for a product and not enough
                    publicity, the producer will have no
                    reason to try and provide goods for a
                    market there. Just as someone would
                    desire a carbon tax upon behaviors that
                    could damage the environment, we are
                    advocating a &ldquo;government footprint
                    statistic&rdquo; to be observed and
                    self-regulated among our associates.

                    It is important to define capitalism
                    because the word has been used to divide
                    us. But it is not irreparable that
                    people now take Capitalism to mean the
                    love of money - it is still important to
                    describe the effects of greed with no
                    accountability for the human or
                    environmental cost. It is true that
                    there is nothing worse than an action
                    that hurts another person knowingly on
                    behalf of personal profit.

                <p>
                    Most who use the word capitalist to
                    describe themselves would say that
                    Capitalism is not greed, in fact, but
                    something truly healing to society which
                    we do not have the chance to observe
                    today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Free market capitalism would still allow
                    for all current safety precautions for
                    example the creation of a myriad of
                    restrictions and certifications that
                    products could voluntarily subject
                    themselves to in order to achieve higher
                    customer satisfaction.

                    When we let people handle things for

                    They say that a better future starts

                    with yourself to make the world a better
                    place. But I think that's a bit too
                    small-minded. Let's all expand our ideas

                    is not doing anything to create anarchy
                    in this lifetime, right now. When we
                    meet an anarchist, we don&rsquo;t try to
                    direct them towards labor but towards
                    intellectual understandings of how to
                    create anarchy in this lifetime. Wealth

                    have to offer - and I missed the sale as

                    If you already have an established
                    network of trade and barter and the
                    products you trade have a long-term

                    statist puts them in a position of
                    having an item they are VERY unlikely to
                    ever give the State. In effect, you make
                    a statist into an economic anarchist.

                    Canning, Dehydrating, Freeze-drying,
                    root cellars, precious metals, freezers,
                    etc can all be used to give a trader
                    more time to sell their goods or
                    services.

                    If I have more freezer space, I am able
                    to accept and preserve a wider variety
                    of consumable and sellable items. If a
                    customer has more freezer space, they
                    are more able to accept a larger amount
                    of beef (for example), which ultimately
                    saves them a lot of money. Morgan and I,
                    for example, don&rsquo;t consider
                    ourselves able to afford to purchase
                    beef in quantities less than 1/4 or 1/2
                    a cow because we now have the freezer
                    space to store it, so we can always buy
                    our meat in bulk which affords us both
                    personal nutrition and a constant
                    product we make available for trade to
                    others.

                    A society can be achieved that is
                    utopian voluntarily in this way:
                </p>
                <p>
                    A free market exists. People are getting
                    their needs met and we are experiencing
                    the real return of our labor and
                    technological advancements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A society forms which is doing away with
                    all forms of toiling that aren&rsquo;t
                    done freely out of passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That society grows and more people see
                    the good things about it. It develops as
                    it grows and learns to accommodate
                    larger amounts of people, breaking down
                    into local groups that can choose their
                    own ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That society voluntarily replaces the
                    current form of society because it
                    provides better than what came before.
