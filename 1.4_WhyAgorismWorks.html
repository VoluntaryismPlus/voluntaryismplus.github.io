	</div>
	<h2><strong><em>We are creating abundance loops.</em></strong></h2>
	<p>An abundance loop is when you find a way to both thrive and have some excess prosperity. We are funneling this towards people who also can create abundance loops. The proliferation of abundance loops will spiral outwards from our own excess.</p>
	<p>As travelers, we are able to sell people's goods just by being where we were going to be already. Our gas money is already accounted for before we will even pick up and travel at all. You do not have to constantly burn gas to be a nomad - but when the network has a supply for the huge demand we currency face for agorist goods - it becomes very lucrative to travel. The opportunity to travel becomes too expensive to pass up.</p>
	<p>This is because within the reality we exist within, being a traveler is a boon as long as there are suppliers of products because there is always a market for agorist products. That is why it becomes important for us to crowdfund farms and producers of agorist goods.</p>
	<p>We have a loop that says: We can do this. There is a need that they will fill. We have the extra piece that needed filling. We will work to fill in the missing piece instead of letting it thwart us.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Which people will understand and continue the feedback loop?</p>
	<div class="headerbox"><h3><strong>Supply and Demand</strong></h3></div>
	<p>Supply and demand means that in a free market, producers will produce goods that they can sell and make a profit off of. But if there aren't enough customers for a product and not enough publicity, the producer will have no reason to try and create a market there. Just as someone would desire for a carbon tax upon behaviors that could damage the environment, we are advocating a government footprint statistic to be observed.</p>
	<p>There is much more wealth to be shared among our net worth than is currently being distributed within it. If the demand is no longer there for local goods in an area, that should not restrict someone from growing a crop or offering something. The caravan and individual people will fill in the network just says semi trucks due today for larger companies.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Our aim is in allowing humans to make the decisions they would naturally make if they were presented with the option to. For example, people will choose the cheaper option that is higher quality and healthier.</p>
	<br><div class="headerbox"><h3 id="section3.1"><strong>Concentration of Wealth</strong></h3></div>
	<p>In win-win interactions, there will always be two people who benefit. The other party in your interaction may be an ally or an enemy. This simple truth is one most neglected in their day-to-day transactions. In times both past and present, families would maintain economic dominance by passing on their wealth to the first-born son or daughter. While we neither support nor oppose such practices, we recognize the value of keeping your wealth within your agorist network rather than watching it bleed back into the system. You can expand this to &ldquo;resource sharing&rdquo; as well, choosing to specialize with or differentiate your offerings from others on your team.</p>
	<p>If your time and effort are put into acquiring products you know are of high value, you should try to pass that value on to trusted members of your network who will recognize and likely utilize your product (such as a quality truck you acquired) toward your common goal of abolishing slavery by ending the State by taking your agorism seriously and directing your wealth in a way that empowers yourself and the allies who are fighting the same fight you are.</p>
	<p>When you give your time and resources to another in a voluntary exchange, give to those who seek to concentrate their wealth into their network/family/community that focuses on manifesting anarchy beyond themselves. Is the person you're selling your goods/services to an anarchist who is actively seeking to manifest anarchy for others? Or are you giving your fruits away to be funneled/fed back into the statist paradigm/system? Vote with your wealth. Let your wealth work for you toward what you're here to accomplish: the abolishment of slavery and freedom of humanity.</p>
	<p>If you're going to take time and focus from other anarchists, do so in a way that focuses on manifesting anarchy for others. If you're going to seek help with things on your property that won't or don't manifest anarchy beyond yourself, then look for statists to fulfill those tasks since they'll at least be wasting their time in a way that benefits you while dodging government extortion fees ("taxes"). This then frees (or at least doesn't tie up) the time and focus of anarchists to manifest more freedom and grow the wealth and infrastructure of the network. Of course, that is not to say that you shouldn't pay other anarchists to tend your own garden for example, just don't pretend like that's in some way making the world more free if it doesn't do anything to actually free anybody.</p>
	<p>It's the taxation that fucking sucks, NOT the degree to which you feel misrepresented by your political overlords. You cannot be represented when you are one among 100,000 people in a sample size. Thats how you dilute your voice! There is only one right that needs to be protected - one right from which stems all others - and that it self ownership.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>When the US was started, there were less people to &ldquo;represent&rdquo; but still a monopoly over representation. If someone found they wanted to remain in their home town with their family history but not subscribe to a certain government law, shouldn&rsquo;t they be allowed to peacefully abstain?</p>
	<div class="headerbox"><h3 id="section3.2"><strong>Keeping it in the Family</strong></h3></div>
	<p><em>Family can be a very important support system for a person. In today&rsquo;s western world, however, children are encouraged to stop sharing resources and leave the family. You don&rsquo;t see multi-generational homesteads anymore. There are many reasons for this, some justified. Even though the family unit has been split, we aim to recreate many of the strengths of the family unit in a healthy way.</em></p>
	<p><em>It is better for your wealth to wind up in the hands of your allies within your network, than in the hands of your enemies. This simple truth most neglect in their day-to-day transactions. In times both past and present, families would maintain economic dominance by passing on their wealth to the first-born son or daughter.

	<p>By choosing not to abide by the zero aggression principle or other related concepts, principles, or boundaries, a person effectively signs and hands over a contract stating that, by their performative actions, they consent to be treated as they treat others.

                    The confrontation: where does your
                    business lead after you have taken care
                    of your basic needs (not necessarily the
                    business needs because a business can be
                    a net negative if it is not formulated
                    properly. Basically, did your business
                    plan include an altruistic vision?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second question: Where are you
                    spending your money? Is it going towards
                    a network that will help you or towards
                    a system that will hurt you?

                    Businesses can be human-centric. You can
                    make a product that helps people. But it
                    needs to organize itself in a dynamic,
                    fluid way. And it also needs a human. In
                    itself, a business can have built into
                    it a philosophy and methodology that
                    makes sure it does not become a negative
                    entity, but it needs humans to enforce
                    that methodology and make sure it is
                    reflective of the outside world. What is
                    the machine that is created? Can you pay

                        <em>Interaction Receipts</em>

                <p>
                    Receipts are proof of interactions that
                    have taken place. A receipt could be
                    created by any interaction between two
                    people, but the quality of the receipt
                    is determined by its vision and scope.
                    Those involved in the interaction will
                    sign off on a description of what took
                    place during this interaction and can
                    add more context in the future upon the
                    agreement of both parties. Work that is
                    completed can use an hourly or
                    interaction receipt. It fulfills certain
                    requirements in the moment, but can also
                    be expanded upon in the future. For
                    example, by being present again and
                    again, and gaining a receipt for each
                    instance, you build trust in others that
                    you will be present more in the future.
                    Receipts do not go away. The
                    achievements they detail usually only
                    get expanded upon, unless there is a
                    dispute. If you&rsquo;re working towards
                    a career, you can build receipts that
                    will count simultaneously towards many
                    things in the future.

                    People value knowing there is a safety
                    net for the poor. Both for people they
                    care about, people who might otherwise
                    hurt them, or for their own sake if they
                    do see a potential for misfortune. The
                    problem is, we all know how easy it
                    would be to solve the issue of
                    homelessness but doing that is often
                    expensive or illegal. We need
                    connections and strength to get more
                    connections and strength. Supply and
                    demand will not provide the market
                    quickly enough until we provide more
                    goods at a cheaper time. We also
                    understand that the stress of high rent
                    and mortgages makes it hard and that is
                    why we are providing affordable housing
                    and jobs that pay more due to not going
                    through the system.&nbsp;

                    Crowdfunding can purchase properties to
                    be divided up and can purchase
                    properties that will be used by people
                    who don't currently desire to own their
                    own plots. Similarly, equipment to meet
                    farming or housing needs can be funded
                    like a CSA - you pay upfront and then
                    get your money back and then some when
                    the product is finished.

                <p>
                    The quickest way to completely remove
                    yourself from your current life or the
                    restrictions therein is to sign up for a
                    visit with an agorist host. Because our
                    network employs Voluntaryism Plus,
                    Agorist Hosts provide a particular type
                    of visit because it is also an entryway
                    into the next realm. You can choose your
                    rate of involvement. After a trial
                    period at a property, your application
                    may be accepted to join a network host
                    environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Network hosts agree on a set period
                    where they will open a section of their
                    property or home to a guest with the
                    intent of helping that person find a
                    better place in the network - be that
                    through finding a new living situation,
                    job, or other personal development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Network hosts are not trying to get
                    labor out of individuals. Their interest
                    lies in introducing people to
                    Voluntaryism and the nonaggression
                    principle while providing them with an
                    opportunity that is consistent with what
                    they desire.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Network Host does not desire only to
                    arrange work trade situations but to
                    direct people into the network and into
                    Guilds. Network Hosts may have a
                    property they include in their hosting
                    or they may meet with people at other
                    spaces, like the caravan, etc.

                    So many of the best people are hidden
                    away from outsiders, or hiding from
                    their own morals by producing wealth and
                    intel for the state. There are real

                    fear retribution from the state if they

                    When there is no network strong enough
                    to support someone they are less likely
                    to take actions they see as dangerous.
                    Similarly, when there is no certainty
                    that there will be a market for
                    someone&rsquo;s farm goods, they
                    won&rsquo;t necessarily have the
                    resources to expand for the risk of
                    having food they can&rsquo;t sell.&nbsp;

                    The same issue arises for consumers of
                    agorist goods. Agorist goods are always
                    cheaper on the conscious than those that
                    fund extortion, but that does not mean
                    they are cheap enough for many to afford
                    in day-to-day life. Additionally,
                    agorist consumers do not find the supply
                    for their own needs to be consistent,
                    varied, or crowd-tested. There can be a
                    lack of options that leads to an unfair
                    market price.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are filling in that gap in supply
                    with dedication and our own manpower.
                    More importantly, the gap is being
                    filled by local people in their own
                    communities. We are simply enabling
                    those interactions. There is much more
                    wealth to be grown in our network than
                    is currently being distributed within
                    it. If the demand is no longer there for
                    local goods in an area, that should not
                    restrict someone from growing a crop or
                    offering something. The caravan and
                    individual people will fill in the
                    network just as semi trucks do today for
                    larger companies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept of supply and demand implies
                    that in a free market, producers will
                    produce goods they can sell for profit.
                    But if there aren&rsquo;t enough
                    customers for a product and not enough
                    publicity, the producer will have no
                    reason to try and provide goods for a
                    market there. Just as someone would
                    desire a carbon tax upon behaviors that
                    could damage the environment, we are
                    advocating a &ldquo;government footprint
                    statistic&rdquo; to be observed and
                    self-regulated among our associates.

                    It is important to define capitalism
                    because the word has been used to divide
                    us. But it is not irreparable that
                    people now take Capitalism to mean the
                    love of money - it is still important to
                    describe the effects of greed with no
                    accountability for the human or
                    environmental cost. It is true that
                    there is nothing worse than an action
                    that hurts another person knowingly on
                    behalf of personal profit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most who use the word capitalist to
                    describe themselves would say that
                    Capitalism is not greed, in fact, but
                    something truly healing to society which
                    we do not have the chance to observe
                    today.

                    Free market capitalism would still allow
                    for all current safety precautions for
                    example the creation of a myriad of
                    restrictions and certifications that
                    products could voluntarily subject
                    themselves to in order to achieve higher
                    customer satisfaction.

                    When we let people handle things for

                    They say that a better future starts
                    with an internal change - that you start
                    with yourself to make the world a better
                    place. But I think that's a bit too
                    small-minded. Let's all expand our ideas

                    is not doing anything to create anarchy
                    in this lifetime, right now. When we
                    meet an anarchist, we don&rsquo;t try to
                    direct them towards labor but towards
                    intellectual understandings of how to
                    create anarchy in this lifetime. Wealth
                    gained is more useful when it is not

                    When attempting to sell cannabis wax on
                    the streets of Oakland, my prospective
                    customers would inform me of the
                    products they would be willing to trade
                    for if not the wax I had available. Many
                    would ask for flower, or some other
                    substance of preference I didn&rsquo;t
                    have to offer - and I missed the sale as
                    a result. My goal was to support the
                    grey and black market by offering
                    products produced and sold by
                    individuals seeking to be free from

                    If you already have an established
                    network of trade and barter and the
                    products you trade have a long-term
                    store-of-value sufficient to easily sell
                    the product before it loses value, then
