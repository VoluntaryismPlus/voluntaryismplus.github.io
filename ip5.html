          You must try to ascertain before getting into a
          relationship with someone whether or not they are
          the right person for you, and don’t make any
          promises until you know.

          This takes time, and we have all been fooled, but

          In a partnership, what each person does reflect
          back on the partnership. This applies to every
          minutia of day-to-day actions. There’s no denying
          that these person is affected by the other person
          decisions, whether that affect is small or large,
          positive negative or neutral.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every action I do is a representation of our
          relationship. If I feel something will go against
          my calling, and that it interferes with what is
          agreed-upon in the relationship, I will try to
          find a way to talk about it and to reach a
          conclusion where I don’t have to go against the
          relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this way, I put the relationship first. I check
          in with the relationship Before I take any action
          because I know that alchemically speaking, there
          is an agreement that I’ve made to respect the
          relationship and its values and boundaries.
