        <p>
          Now that you have established your relationship
          dynamic, it's time to make your initial agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is our initial agreement with each element
          broken down and explained.

            Before I enter a relationship with you, I will
            make sure that the following is true for me.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Relationships started without a good amount of
          deliberation are often suffering from a lack of
          communication and skewed expectations. Sometimes
          people are trying to be desirable and so they hide
          parts of themselves that they think are less
          attractive. This is bound to end badly because
          then your partner doesn't know who they are in a
          relationship with.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are already in a relationship, you can
          still salvage it if both partners are willing.
          Your partner might be excited to learn who you
          really are. You may want to reflect on what would
          have been different if you had taken these steps
          before making it official. We encourage you to
          forgive yourself and your partner for any mistakes
          made because of a lack of clarity when the
          relationship started.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can always refresh the relationship with a new
          agreement that serves both people better.

            1. I do not believe that love is a feeling that
            can go away, but a choice. I take responsibility
            for the healthy interpretation and resolution of
            any feelings I have as long as you are also
            willing to work with me on the root causes and
            results of these feelings.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          If love was a feeling, it could be possible to
          wake up one morning and not be in love any more.
          We have noticed that when this supposedly happens,
          it is either because something in the relationship
          is not working, or because the person who falls
          out of love believes that love is a feeling that
          can go away randomly like when you stop liking a
          certain song.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is one of many beliefs that can ruin a
          relationship. More of these beliefs are covered in
          <a href="ip6.html">Step Six</a>.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            2. I acknowledge the relationship dynamic we
            have agreed upon and I will work to maintain my
            promises.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            3. I am willing to make changes to my way of
            doing things, or to myself, in order to be a
            better partner for you.
          </p>

        <p></p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            4. I promise that if anything comes up that
            threatens our relationship, like:<br />- I am
            changing <br />- I am discovering new things
            about myself <br />- I am discovering more about
            you <br />- I have met someone who I like
            <br />- I am commiserating with others
            <br /><br />
            I will tell you as soon as I realize it, before
            I make any new conclusions that bring us farther
            apart, and I will give you the opportunity to be
            involved in any conclusions I make.

            5. I have a method by which any problems can be
            addressed, and I do not believe these
            experiences have power over us but that we have
            the power to use the learning they hold to make
            us stronger.
