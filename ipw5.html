          This worksheet act as an informal prerequisite to
          “aligning our daily lives”. The concept of the
          worksheet is identifying priorities and then
          assessing different behaviors or actions with
          regard to what priority they are serving and how
          important they are in the service of that
          priority.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will be a worksheet that each person fills
          out independently, and then on the third page,
          they will work to create a shared vision for what
          their priorities are as a couple.
        </p>
        <p>
          The behaviors discussed on the individual pages
          fall into different sections: behaviors that each
          partner finds unimportant or not helpful that the
          other partner does, a section for behaviors each
          person feels misunderstood in that they do, and
          behaviors that each partner thinks would help
          strengthen the bond and support the couples
          priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          This worksheet directly addresses the core of
          aligning individual lives within a partnership and
          provides a structured way to uncover hidden
          assumptions and intentions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This worksheet is designed to help you
          individually clarify your core priorities and
          then, as a couple, align on your shared vision. A
          strong, lasting partnership is built on
          understanding not just what each person does, but
          why they do it, and how those actions serve their
          deepest values.
