				</h2>
				<p>
					We are practicing voluntaryism with a
					twist. Voluntaryism plus intention. To
					get a more concise and potent result, we
					are more concise with our parameters.
					Those parameters are simply: are you
					making the world more free for just
					yourself? Or does your plan make the
					world more free for others as well? We
					are not judging those who do not follow
					these parameters, but we are making a
					distinction within our own decisions. We
					will prioritize doing business with
					those who share a similar requirement in
					their vision.
				</p>
				<p>
					Does one's strong preference for
					voluntaryism over statism necessarily
					make them a full-blown voluntaryist,
					even while their lifestyle design serves
					as a perpetual boon to the State?
					Freedom will not be granted to you. It
					can be had, but must be taken.
				</p>
				<p>
					Look to where your resources flow. How
					far does your dollar go? How many hops
					before draining back into the state? The
					people you sell to and do business with
					- are they bolstering all of our futures
					with their time, energy, and focus? Or
					is it being wasted on endeavors that
					ultimately entangle their existences
					with the state, bolstering it while our
					own support networks are getting starved
					out? Once you have taken care of your
					own basic needs, where does the excess
					go? What are you choosing to do with
					your life, and who is that benefitting?
				</p>
				<p>
					Free Markets are at (economic) war with
					un-Free Markets. If you are a producer
					or provider of a good or service, are
					you spending your time adding value to
					the lives of people who seek freedom
					from the State and its extortive
					impositions? If not, which side of the
					economic war are you fighting on? How
					much of what you earn goes into the
					hands of the enemy, the State, and all
					who support the destruction of freedom?
					How much of your is spent making the
					free-market choice superior to the
					un-Free market choices that that fund
					the war-machine and mass-incarceration
					of human beings?
				</p>
				<p>
					We favor business with people who align
					with our pro-liberty and anti-government
					and anti-taxation and pro-free-market
					ideals. Those are the kinds of folk we
					want to spend our time serving, and whom
					we will go out of our way to ensure
					customer satisfaction with. That said,
					if someone doesn't align with us in one
					or more of those ways, but still happens
					to enjoy a good or service we provide,
					we are still glad they got to try out
					that small taste of what agorism and the
					free market can provide.

						>For Individuals, Intention is the
						Criteria</em

				</h4>
				<p>
					One reaction to being born into a world
					where you are under attack is to seek an
					isolated existence in which you put all
					your effort into your own survival and
					bettering a few people around you in
					small ways. There is a natural and
					rational fear that any individual can
					have of putting their survival into the
					hands of other people. At the same time,
					certain commodities cannot be made
					locally and have to be outsourced. Aside
					from a primitivist society, the
					self-sufficiency of a network is
					deepened through its access to different
					types of connections, anonymized and
					protected as needed by pgp.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the issue of personal privacy and
					security is taken care of, you can look
					to grow your network in ways that serve
					you far greater than is currently
					possible and offer you a type of
					physical insurance and security that is
					not available to many people in this
					world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Intention means everything. If your
					intention is to serve yourself to the
					fullest extent, are you open to ways do
					you also consider that your world would
					improve far more the more connections
					you allowed to serve the extended
					version of the network?
				</p>
				<p>
					To put it simply, we are looking for
					people who are both enabling themselves
					to be completely free of the government
					and enabling others to be free. But
					there are several ways we define this
					for clarification purposes:
				</p>
				<p>
					Every individual or group we work with:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">
						<ul>
							<li>
								Follows the NAP
								(non-agression principle).
							</li>
							<li>
								Understands our plan towards
								a voluntaryist society.
							</li>
							<li>
								Has their own plan toward a
								voluntaryist life for all
								that extends beyond their
								own survival.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					A business plan in itself will not
					create a voluntaryist society. A
					business plan that supports itself does
					nothing more than float a ship on a sea
					that is falsely claimed as property by
					the State.
				</p>
				<br />
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h4 id="section2.2">
						<em
							>For Communities, Conflict
							Resolution is the Criteria</em
						>
					</h4>
				</div>
				<p>
					We try to mirror the pluralist society
					as much as we can and allow for
					ingenuity to guide the shape of the
					network as it develops over time.
					However, there are certain constraints
					we do make to form our structures on
					positive axioms. So while there do not
					need to be rules that restrict others
					from In every community, there is always
					a method for what happens when there is
					conflict. What we want is to encourage
					communities that make it clear the exact
					method of conflict resolution they
					unanimously agree to employ. For each
					person who is looking to be connected to
					a community, it serves the individual to
					have an understanding and agree to the
					arbitration to be employed if there is a
					dispute within the community.
				</p>
				<p>
					If there are public spaces, there will
					be disputes in which two parties are
					both seeking to remain in the group for
					various reasons.
