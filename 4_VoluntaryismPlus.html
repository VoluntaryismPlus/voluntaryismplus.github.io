				<em>Voluntaryism, Plus</em>

			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="callout">
					<p>
						&ldquo;They are only leaders if you follow
						them&rdquo; - Unknown
					</p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;If a law suits me, I follow
						it&hellip;&rdquo;

				</h2>
				<p>
					Our approach is Voluntaryism with a twist. It’s a
					call to move beyond simply believing in the
					philosophy to actively and intentionally building
					the world we want to see. We believe that to
					achieve a truly free society, we must be precise
					with our parameters. The core question is simple:
					<strong
						>Does your plan make the world more free for
						just yourself, or does it also enable freedom
						for others?</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					We don’t judge those who only focus on their own
					autonomy, but we make a critical distinction in
					our own decisions. We prioritize doing business
					with those who share a similar commitment to
					expanding liberty for all.
				</p>

				<h3>The Call to Action: Take Your Freedom</h3>
				<p>
					Does a strong preference for voluntaryism make one
					a full-blown voluntaryist, even while their
					lifestyle perpetuates the State? Freedom is not a
					gift to be granted; it must be consciously and
					intentionally built.
				</p>
				<p>
					Look at where your resources flow. How far does
					your dollar go? How many transactions does it take
					before your wealth drains back into the State?
					Consider the people you trade with: are they
					bolstering our collective future with their time,
					energy, and focus? Or are they entangled in
					endeavors that ultimately strengthen the State,
					starving our support networks in the process? Once
					your basic needs are met, what do you do with your
					surplus? How are you choosing to live, and who
					benefits from your choices?
				</p>
				<p>
					Free Markets are at economic war with un-Free
					Markets. If you are a producer or provider, are
					you spending your time adding value to the lives
					of people who seek freedom from the State and its
					extortive impositions? If not, which side of the
					economic war are you fighting on? How much of what
					you earn goes into the hands of the enemy—the
					State and its war machine? We aim to make the
					free-market choice so superior that it becomes a
					no-brainer.
				</p>
				<p>
					We favor doing business with people who align with
					our pro-liberty, anti-government, anti-taxation,
					and pro-free-market ideals. These are the people
					we will go out of our way to serve and ensure
					customer satisfaction with. That said, if someone
					doesn’t align with us but enjoys a good or service
					we provide, we are still glad they get to
					experience a small taste of what agorism and the
					free market can provide.

				<h2>The Strengths of Voluntaryism Plus</h2>
				<p>
					Adopting Voluntaryism Plus gives you clear goals
					for your interactions and a tangible roadmap
					toward a freer way of life. It’s not just a
					philosophy; it’s a strategy for living.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Keeping it in the Family:</strong>
							Your resources stay within our network,
							building our collective wealth and resilience.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Strength in Numbers:</strong> Every
							aligned interaction strengthens our community.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Win-Win Contracts:</strong> All
							agreements are mutually beneficial, based on
							consent and trust.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Abundance Loops:</strong> Our economic
							model generates more wealth and opportunity
							for all participants.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>The Time Machine:</strong> Our caravan
							and nomadic lifestyle accelerate the growth of
							the Network, bridging geographical gaps and
							creating more quality time for all involved.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<h2>The Criteria for Engagement</h2>
				<p>
					We understand that stepping away from the state
					can be daunting. There is a natural, rational fear
					of putting your survival into the hands of a
					decentralized network. But true self-sufficiency
					is deepened through access to diverse connections,
					with privacy and security protected through tools
					like PGP. When your personal security is taken
					care of, you can focus on growing a network that
					provides a type of physical insurance and security
					unavailable in the statist world.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h4>For Individuals, Intention is the Criteria</h4>
				<p>
					Your intention is everything. If your goal is to
					be completely free of the government, are you open
					to the idea that your world would improve even
					more by serving the extended network?
				</p>
				<p>
					To be clear, we are looking for people who are
					committed to enabling both themselves and others
					to be free. We define this through three key
					criteria for every individual or group we work
					with:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Follows the NAP:</strong> Adherence to
							the non-aggression principle in all
							interactions.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Understands the Plan:</strong> A clear
							understanding of our vision for a voluntaryist
							society.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Extends the Vision:</strong> Has a
							personal plan that extends beyond their own
							survival to actively support others’ freedom.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
					A self-sustaining business plan alone does not
					create a voluntaryist society; it merely allows a
					ship to float on a sea still claimed by the State.
					Your plan must help build the new sea.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h4>
					For Communities, Conflict Resolution is the
					Criteria
				</h4>
				<p>
					We mirror a pluralist society and allow ingenuity
					to guide our network's development. However, we
					form our structures on positive axioms. In every
					community, there is a method for resolving
					conflict. We encourage communities to clearly
					define the exact method of conflict resolution
					that they unanimously agree to employ. It serves
					every individual to understand and consent to the
					arbitration process before joining a community.
					This transparency is key to building trust in
					public spaces where disputes can arise.
				</p>

				<h3>Examples of "Voluntaryism Plus" in Action</h3>
				<p>
					To make this philosophy tangible, let's look at
					how it manifests in the real world. These are not
					just ideas; they are active, daily choices that
					build the new world we envision.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>The Agorist Farmer:</strong> A
							permaculture farmer grows an abundance of food
							using sustainable methods, but their impact
							doesn't stop there. Instead of selling their
							produce at a state-run farmers market or
							through taxed grocery stores, they exclusively
							sell and barter their goods through a local
							agorist directory and to a network of
							like-minded individuals. They accept payment
							in decentralized cryptocurrency or other goods
							and services, ensuring every dollar earned
							stays within the free economy and directly
							bolsters the Network's strength. This farmer
							isn't just feeding themselves; they are
							fortifying the economic foundation of a free
							society.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>The Nomadic Developer:</strong> A
							skilled software developer chooses to live a
							minimalist, nomadic life. They don't just earn
							a living remotely; they dedicate their skills
							to building decentralized applications, secure
							communication platforms, and private
							directories for the Network. They accept
							payment exclusively in cryptocurrency or
							through barter, ensuring their income stream
							is entirely outside the State's grasp. By
							dedicating a portion of their time to these
							projects, they are building the essential
							digital infrastructure that empowers
							everyone's freedom and privacy.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>The Artisan Collective:</strong> A
							group of crafters, from weavers to
							woodworkers, wants to open a shared workshop.
							Instead of navigating restrictive zoning laws,
							costly permits, and bureaucratic inspections,
							they acquire a piece of private land. They
							build their workshop themselves, pooling their
							skills and resources to create a shared space
							completely free from state interference. By
							trading their creations directly with
							customers in the Agora, they are demonstrating
							that craftsmanship and community can flourish
							without government oversight.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h3>A Call to Introspection: A Self-Assessment</h3>
				<p>
					Ready to assess your own position in the economic
					war? The first step toward a life of intention is
					honest self-reflection. Ask yourself the following
					questions, and use the linked resources to help
					guide your journey.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Where does my income come from, and where
								does it go?</strong
							>
							Trace your resources from their origin to
							their destination. How much is spent on goods
							and services that fund state institutions?
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong
								>What percentage of my energy is spent on
								complying with statist regulations versus
								building freedom?</strong
							>
							Are you spending more time filing taxes and
							filling out forms, or are you creating
							something new and free?
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Am I a net drain or a net contributor to
								the free market?</strong
							>
							Does your lifestyle perpetuate the State, or
							does it actively starve it of resources?
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong
								>What is one small step I can take this week
								to align my resources with my
								values?</strong
							>
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>The Future: A Flourishing Pluralist Society</h3>
				<p>
					When enough individuals adopt the philosophy of
					Voluntaryism Plus, the result is a world beyond
					your wildest dreams—a world of flourishing
					pluralism.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<p>
						Imagine thousands of diverse, independent
						communities, each with its own unique culture,
						customs, and polycentric legal systems for
						conflict resolution. These communities are not
						isolated; they are interconnected by vibrant
						Agorist markets, Guilds, and nomadic caravans.
						This is a world where innovation thrives because
						there is no central authority to stifle it,
						where disputes are resolved through mediation
						and restitution, not violence and punishment,
						and where abundance replaces scarcity as the
						dominant mindset. This is the True Realm—a
						reality built on consent, creativity, and
						connection, where every person's path is a
						testament to the power of shared intention.
