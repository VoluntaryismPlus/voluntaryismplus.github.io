        <p>
          Everyone has a need for security, relaxation,
          comfort and fun. If you don't get these needs met,
          you can run into problems with physical and mental
          health, and create coping patterns that damage
          your relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, you deserve to have a partner who is
          excited about you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way the current world is organized makes it
          difficult to live in a way that gets all of these
          needs met.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          A healthy relationship acknowledges that neither
          partner is at fault for these worldly
          difficulties. The current system is hard to
          navigate, especially while maintaining a lived
          experience of joy and security.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to make sure that you know what
          you desire regardless of how feasible it is. The
          current culture tells us that we should only
          desire what is reasonable, but that is not the way
          our hearts work. We want the best possible world
          for ourselves, and if we deny this fact, we deny a
          part of our selves.

          In today's culture, there are many ideas that are
          proliferated as enduring truths but which are not
          actually true and which are instead damaging to
          relationships.

              <p>
                Reasoning: You would become suffocated. No

                passion would go away. Everyone gets boring
                or annoying eventually.

        <p>
          It does not have to get uncomfortable to spend all
          of your time with someone. Your partner should
          excite you. You should want to spend all your time
          with them because you respect them and their
          opinion enough that you want to share all your
          experiences with them. Your life should be filled
          with shared meaning and exploration, such that any
          time away from each other would be missing out.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is okay not to achieve this, but you should
          desire to. It might not be logistically possible,
          but you should value your shared time together and
          keep trying to get as much time as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          What about activities that your partner isn’t into
          or doesn’t want to do with you? <br /><br />You
          should see the value of spending that time with
          your partner because of the positivity you get
          from being together. If they value something you
          think is unimportant or negative, then you or they
          might want to rethink those activities. The goal
          is to value each other's world view and to learn
          about what function each activity plays in your
          partner's life.

              You should have your own life path and
              passions separate from those of your partner.
              <br /><br />
              <p>
                Reasoning: It's "healthy" to have your own
                passions so that you can differentiate
                yourself as a person separate from your
                partner.

        <p>
          If you can find someone who has a passion for the
          same things that you do, then you have a wonderful
          base for a relationship. You can work with
          eachother, learn with each other, network with
          eachother and help each other through whatever
          problems may arise without having to juggle two
          separate vocations.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, if you have your own separate
          passions, there will always be the possibility of
          someone out there being a better match for your
          partner, because that person is passionate about
          more of the same things. You want to give your
          partner the highest possible experience, which
          could include a partner who shares these passions.

              Humans are not meant to be in monogamous, long

              <p>
                Reasoning: Apes do not get married. Some

          Being with your perfect partner forever is the
          best option <em>if they are the right person</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lifetime is not enough time to spend with
          someone who is your perfect life partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there are no people in the world that you
          recognize as perfect for you, you just need to
          keep looking. Do not subject someone to a
          relationship with you when they could be finding
          their own perfect partner, even if they say they
          have given up. Perhaps their perfect partner is
          going to surprise them! Or yours might surprise
          you!

              <p>
                Reasoning: It is "unhealthy" for you to
                expect one person to meet all of your needs
                because you have so many needs and that
                would overload the other person.

        <p>
          You do not <em>need</em> to get any of your needs
          met outside of the relationship - but you are
          welcome to when the interaction is healthy. It is
          unhealthy to interact in a way that places another
          person in a position to grow closer to you than
          your partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you get several of your needs met through
          friends and family, that is great. But the more
          needs you meet with your partner, the less likely
          you are to grow apart from eachother. There will
          be more understanding. What if you were stuck in a
          bunker with this person for several months?

          We know from experience, it <em>is</em> possible!
