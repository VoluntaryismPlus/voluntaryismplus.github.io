							>&ldquo;Conceptually, Voluntaryism is a very
							simple moral philosophy &ndash; it is the
							basic proposition that all human interaction
							should be directly consensual. Voluntaryism
							rejects the initiation of force in all its
							various forms including physical violence,
							threats of violence, theft, bullying, slavery,
							rape, murder, etc. However, unlike Pacifism,
							Voluntaryism does not bar the victim of
							coercion from responding in a strictly
							self-defensive manner.&rdquo;</em

					</p>
					<p>
						- Peter Miller, Introduction to Voluntaryism
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<p>
					Voluntaryism is the moral philosophy that all
					forms of interaction should be voluntary, and that
					the only just use of force is defensive force. We
					abide by the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP) which
					dictates that no action be taken that violates
					another&rsquo;s consent if not in
					self-defense.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					If we are to apply this philosophy consistently,
					then we have to hold the people who call
					themselves "the government" to the same standards
					as anyone else. To paraphrase Mark Corske&rsquo;s
					&ldquo;Engines of Domination: Political Power and
					the Human Emergency&rdquo;:&nbsp;
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="calloutcenter">
						<p>
							<em
								>Voluntary relations are the opposite of
								power relations, and communities are best
								organized by voluntary relations.&nbsp;</em
							>
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					That is, relations among equals, and not between
					rulers and subjects. Voluntaryists are typically
					not fans of government in principle, nor do they
					think that the institution of coercive government
					is necessary. We recognize that there are two ways
					that people can relate to one another: voluntarily
					or coercively. Voluntaryists embrace the former
					and reject the latter.
				</p>
				<p>
					This also implies that there are no rights that
					can be granted to an individual that aren&rsquo;t
					shared by all individuals - such as any rights one
					pretends they can grant the
					&ldquo;government&rdquo; to rule over
					others&rsquo; lives and livelihoods. Rights are
					those actions no individual may prevent others
					from engaging in without violating their freedom
					to peacefully co-exist in ways that do not violate
					the consent of those directly involved. You have
					the right to use force against those who seek to
					restrict your rights. Rights can neither be
					granted nor revoked. They are either respected or
					not. It is our responsibility to keep tyranny in
					check.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ultimately, no one thinks that anyone should need
					to rule over them - especially someone that they
					didn&rsquo;t choose themselves - which means no
					one really supports involuntary rulership over
					themselves. And yet due to a lack of options as
					well as various methods of social and
					psychological conditioning, many people think that
					some groups possess the right to intimidate and
					initiate force against others and enslave them.
					Because some live with intent to enslave, so too
					must some live with intent to liberate.
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h4><em>An Exception for Self-Defense</em></h4>
				</div>
				<p>
					Very few set out with the intent to hurt others
					unprovoked. When considering options available in
					a provocation with another person, everyone
					understands that the cops won&rsquo;t show up in
					time to help and yet many people still don&rsquo;t
					carry self-protection tools or techniques. You
					have the right to choose strategies, tools, and
					techniques to defend yourself and should be
					empowered to do so by not being forced or coerced
					into funding things you may not agree with.

						<strong>Voluntary Pluralism</strong>
					</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext1">
						<p>
							<em
								>Pluralism: a condition or system in which
								two or more states, groups, principles,
								sources of authority, etc., coexist.</em
							>
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					There will be countless methods of organization in
					a pluralist society. People are free to create
					living situations that suit them. Pluralism would
					look like many different organization styles and
					provision-strategies coexisting in a decentralized
					fashion.
				</p>
				<p>
					Just as all goods and services presently
					provisioned by authoritarian centralized States
					should only be considered as
					<strong><em>strategies</em></strong> toward
					meeting needs, rather than as needs in and of
					themselves (e.g. &ldquo;police are a strategy for
					meeting your need for protection, but they are not
					a need in and of themselves), so too will the keen
					observer recognize that any one strategy cannot
					and will not meet the needs and preferences of
					most, and all attempts to bend that fabric of
					reality have led to the destruction of freedom for
					all in various ways.
				</p>
				<p>
					When someone asks whether there will be a certain
					type of community or enclave in a pluralist world,
					the answer is yes, as long as the enclave respects
					the NAP and employs the SDP (Self-Defense
					Principle) and RoR (Right of Restitution). The
					question would be: Do they have healthy boundaries
					around how other groups choose to organize, trade,
					and associate with one-another in their own
					spaces? With pluralism, each enclave is able to
					exist independently with its own rules, norms, and
					customs as long as they do not engage in or permit
					to persist or stand unchecked, aggressive force or
					coercion. You can&rsquo;t force others to adopt
					your norms in areas where voluntary pluralism is
					the respected norm, except with regard to your
					person and property.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="outerimage">

			<div class="innersection">
				<p>
					Pluralism regarding the State would necessitate a
					shift toward voluntary participation and funding,
					rather than extortion and threats aimed at forcing
					centralized goods and services down our throats.
					This should not be a concern to the keen observer
					because we see voluntary participation and funding
					working everywhere in the private sector.
					Pluralism puts the public&rsquo;s economic power
					directly into the hands of its constituents while
					shielding the masses from any losses sustained by
					private-sector-imprudence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pluralism lends credence to the &ldquo;if you
					don&rsquo;t like it, you can leave&rdquo; phrase
					in a voluntary society because you can always
					choose the other option(s) available and nobody
					has dominion beyond their actual property. This
					choosing-power is a very powerful freedom for an
					individual to possess, and it is worth securing
					and protecting.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pluralism replacing winner-takes-all
					politico-statism would take the perception of
					power and influence out of the hands of the
					political elite while giving the public&rsquo;s
					constituents (that is, each individual) their
					voice and power back. Because the cost of failure
					is borne by the private owner(s) of a voluntary
					organization rather than &ldquo;society as a
					whole&rdquo; who has no such investment at stake,
					and because customers are free to choose
					organizations that best suit their (the
					customer&rsquo;s) individual preferences and
					needs, this is a guaranteed better strategy to
					meet the needs of humanity in communities of any
					size or scale. As long as individuals are free to
					associate and disassociate with whom they choose
					without punishment or retaliation, pluralism will
					enable people to thrive and peacefully coexist
					regardless of the difference in their values or
					preferences.

						<strong>You Own Your Self</strong>

								>You own yourself and therefore possess the
								higher claim of authority over yourself and

						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Self-ownership is one of the basic tenets of the
					logic we live by. We have found no evidence to
					counteract this tenet and thus we hold it as a
					very secure fact. Every individual reading these
					words is the sole owner in themselves.
				</p>
				<p>
					You own your mind through homesteading your body
					because your body is your home, and you stead it.
					You exclusively home-stead your mind and body and
					thus possess the highest claim to exclude others
					from the use of yourself. You are responsible for
					and act in good service and upkeep toward your
					body and mind more than anyone else does or could.
					For these reasons, you are the perpetual
					homesteader and owner of your mind and body and
					exercise the highest claim of authority over
					yourself.
				</p>
				<p>
					The philosophy of self-ownership provides a way to
					navigate some contentious topics. It answers some
					more obvious questions but does not pretend to
					provide answers to all questions. However, the
					rest of the questions can and will be answered by
					the philosophical application of
					Directionality.&nbsp;

					<h2 id="section1.1"><strong>Property</strong></h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					Self-ownership extends to property. There are
					distinctions within many philosophies that lead to
					the concepts such as &ldquo;abandonment
					periods&rdquo; and &ldquo;sticky property&rdquo;,
					which are norms that develop among people which
					dictate the abandonment conditions or special use
					cases for certain types of property such as land.
				</p>
				<p>
					Property is a strategy aimed at the reduction of
					conflict over scarce resources. It is the concept
					that an individual or group of individuals can
					decide the proper state of a particular thing,
					such as but not limited to who may use it, under
					what terms, etc.

						<strong>Am I a Voluntaryist?</strong>

				</div>
				<p>
					Most people would answer that they agree with the
					tenets of Voluntaryism. The time when this changes
					is when it comes to controlling and affecting
					other people&rsquo;s right to self-ownership
					through actions of the state. Things like
					winner-take-all politics, majority-rule voting,
					and (others) are direct violations of the NAP.
					There are alternate strategies and solutions to

					The word &ldquo;statist&rdquo; may refer to
					someone who believes the state must exist. They
					may belive that it is the best option, or the only
					option. In reality, the state has no legitimacy -
					and we have the opportunity to foster a
					voluntaryist world in its place. There is no such
					thing as someone granting a right they do not have
					themselves. And nobody has a right to make a
					decision for someone else. All of us who care must
					outweigh the few who actually want to make others
					suffer. If there&rsquo;s an issue with a violation
					of the NAP, that is a perfect time to discuss and
					practice some voluntary conflict resolution.
				</p>
				<p>
					We want people to be able to pursue any avenue
					they want, as long as it does not harm another
					individual or group. We recognize people have the
					ability to govern themselves because they own
					themselves. We also then necessarily recognize
					that no individual nor group of individuals has
					authority over other individuals or groups.

						<p class="questions"><em>I vote?</em></p>
						<p>
							It depends. Within the current system, you
							must be very choosy to be voluntaryist with
							your voting. In most cases, as with
							&ldquo;electing officials&rdquo;, you are
							forcing your opinion on another person. If you
							were able to vote on an issue that only
							increased freedom, like removing a tax, that
							would be voluntaryist.
						</p>
						<p class="questions">
							<em>I want to live by a set of rules?</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							Most likely, yes. All rules can coexist as
							long as they don&rsquo;t initiate violence or
							coercion aka take away the consent of others.
							All forms of rules are &lsquo;allowed&rsquo;
							as long as they don&rsquo;t initiate violence

						</p>
						<p>
							Yes. Look into other means of rule
							enforcement. There is much literature on this.
						</p>
						<p class="questions">
							<em
								>If I think that humans cannot govern
								themselves?</em
							>
						</p>
						<p>
							Not necessarily. For example, religious
							anarchists like Leo Tolstoy believe that God
							governs humans. In a pluralistic voluntary
							society people have all sorts of voluntary
							enclaves with their own versions of governance
							to choose from.
						</p>
						<p class="questions">
							<em>If I believe in private property?</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							Not necessarily. There are many different
							views on property, but most Voluntaryists
							believe in private property while rejecting
							compulsory enforcement thereover by a third
							party. Enforcement of private property is the
							sole responsibility of the property owner.
