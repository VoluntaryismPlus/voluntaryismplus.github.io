			<div class="innersection">
				<p>
					The likelihood of a proposal&rsquo;s success or
					failure lies in its definition and terms. Because
					the network is a system of ideas that can be
					recreated by anyone who has heard the methodology,
					our proposal is one that requires no money and no
					one person or group to bring it through to
					completion. All that is needed is a simple
					redirection of attention and resources away from
					what is unsavory and towards a network that will
					truly provide for us.
				</p>
				<p>
					An idea cannot fail when its success does not rely
					on monetary achievement, any one person attaining
					notoriety for a project, or the first iteration of
					the project to see the goal to completion.
					Different projects have failed due to definition
					alone. If the definition of success is that one
					location persists or that one group of people
					survives, the plan is not great enough.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyone in the next 100 years could find this set
					of instructions and re-create what we are doing
					now. But there will be no need to start from
					scratch. As soon as the number of people are
					proliferating the ideas contained herein, there
					will be more aversions and more resiliency because
					of them. We do not need to be attributed to the
					version that succeeds. We will always only be one
					group who saw what was possible. I made sure to
					write down our ideas as we lived them out.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your work should be designed so that you want it
					to be stolen. Through replication grows notoriety.
					More people exposed means more people knowing it
					exists at all. If one person's desire for
					recognition, for ownership of an idea, an entire
					project can fail to launch. Our plan is, among
					other things, to spread to all people the
					recognition of what is possible and what is
					lacking in the current narrative. This will make
					it easier to take responsibility for ones own
					narrative outlook that they ultimately share with
					the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is the workbook for how the world succeeds
					when enough of us choose to do so.&nbsp;

					The high-level overview of our plan goes like
					this:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">
						<ol>
							<li>
								Those who already know about voluntaryism
								are all we need to make this happen. They
								redirect all of their resources of labor and
								thought to the free world, with a purely
								agorist marketplace and protected living
								spaces where all interactions exist free of
								the state.
							</li>
							<li>
								The marketplace flourishes and people from
								the cities start coming to our marketplaces
								and our events and learning about the real
								applications of voluntaryism and how to
								create, find, or access their local network
								of protected free markets.
							</li>
							<li>
								Slowly the state loses its grasp on our
								hearts, minds, and resources and we
								transition fully into the new realm.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h4>
					<em
						>Join us in our journey to defund the state
						through counter-economics.</em
					>
				</h4>
				<p>
					<em
						>We don&rsquo;t need to convert anyone to our
						cause. There are enough people already comitted
						to liberty. All we need is to provide all those
						liberty-loving people more opportunities to work
						together so that all of their wealth and time
						can be channeled into more wealth for them.</em
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					We can all imagine ways that a limited number of
					people could take down the beast. For example, if
					all liberty minded individuals refused to pay
					taxes, and it became a well known movement, then
					there is a good probability that the news would
					become viral and enough people would join in this
					endeavor to defund the governemnt. There are also
					easy ideas for how to operate as a society beyond
					this defunding - coordinating with your friends
					and neighbors to show up as a group to the scene
					of a dispute or incident is a great example. This
					is also the concept of militia. Strong ubiquitous
					self-defense is how we will defend ourselves
					against foreign or domestic threats. We are
					providing and helping to provide whatever extra
					support systems are needed to get the solution
					going and to normalize the conversations around
					the new lexicon of reality and the idea of having
					no overarching government.

						<strong>Making The Switch</strong>
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					We do not need to escape this world. We have
					everything we need here to create the next phase
					of existence. This is the world that, in time,
					becomes the ideal world for each individual. How
					can each person have their own ideal coexisting
					with every other person&rsquo;s ideal,
					simultaneously? The answer is voluntary pluralism.
				</p>
				<p>
					To get a more concise and potent result, we are
					more concise with our parameters. We are not
					judging those who do not follow these parameters,
					but we are making a distinction within our own
					decisions to do business with others who are
					actively creating more freedom for others instead
					of creating only a space for themselves to
					temporarily reduce their own oppression while
					doing little to manifest or support protected free
					markets.
				</p>
				<br />
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h4>
						<em
							>We believe in real solutions, right now!</em
						>
					</h4>
				</div>
				<p>
					We do not want to spend our lives working for
					other people&rsquo;s goals while doing nothing or
					very little toward what we are in this realm to
					achieve, which has nothing to do with slaving away
					for money.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a guide to the establishment of a society
					that is independent, interconnected, and free from
					coercion. Today, we have everything we need to
					circumvent the state entirely. Communities small
					and large are already flourishing all around the
					world, and what is lacking in the common lore is a
					larger and more liberating story we can all
					manifest into reality.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>The next sections will address the following:</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div
						class="callouttext"
						style="padding: 10px 10px 10px 38px">
						<ol>
							<li>People don&rsquo;t see an option</li>
							<li>We are creating an option</li>
							<li>You can create an option</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Understanding what is possible will lead to a more
					extensive awareness and empowered utilization of
					these communities, both with each other and by
					those still more entrenched in the slave society.

						<strong><em>Our Exit Strategy:</em></strong>
					</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					Government should be optional, not required. We
					are FREE people, are we not? We aren&rsquo;t
					trying to abolish the State. If there are people
					who still wish to use a State for provision of
					specific goods or services, they should still be
					free to contract in such ways, but again, they in
					the NEW realm will enter into such contracts
					voluntarily and with the free-will choice to say
					no without punishment or retaliation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The idea is to help everyone who is having trouble
					redirecting their income stream and expenditures
					to purely agorist sources - so that we can keep
					the wealth in the family and grow a system that
					will stand resolute against all threats.
				</p>
				<p>
					We know this will work and we want to help form
					and strengthen the bonds that will replace weak
					supply lines currently &ldquo;providing&rdquo; for
					us. The necessity of the State is the story we
					tell ourselves. We can get everyone we know to
					stop telling that story. We are building a network
					of capable people who can protect each other and
					the world. We are on voluntary teams that work
					outside of the government.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have a business model that cannot fail. The
					value people are already generating can be
					redirected towards the agorist network and thus go
					much further towards true growth and prosperity.
					This enables a lifestyle maximized for
					freedom.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					All interactions we take part in are in a free and
					sovereign world. We are taking all transactions
					out of the city. We are making sure the money we
					spend goes towards a system that will protect us,
					not towards a system that will hurt us. So every
					interaction should be taken from the
					government/taxes and utilized by only
					voluntaryists who are making the new world.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are creating spaces that you can live in free
					of charge so that you can detox for as long as you
					need. Our network provides a means of achieving
					whatever life goals you have in a way that
					doesn&rsquo;t fund wars but actually helps others
					gain security. You will see the way in which you
					can finally align yourself with the way you are
					acting out your own real-life adventure. We have a
					way to help you expand your impact on those you
					care about while reducing your risk and the risk
					of those you do business with. With our network,
					you have the prospect of real security, wealth,
					privacy, and community. On top of all of this, you
					will witness the structure of the world change
					based on your input.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you see what is really possible in this
					moment, in this lifetime, you will see the value
					of embarking on your own journey in the Realm. All
					it takes is spreading this knowledge to the people
					who will want to do something about it and create
					the change they want to see.
				</p>
				<p>
					The knowledge of our slavery is hardly as
					important as the knowledge of our power and all
					the tools and manpower that we already have at our
					disposal to fight back against tyrants through
					nonviolent, non-confrontational means.

				<p>
					We do not need any one leg of the engine to
					survive continuously for the engine to roll on.
					Any single hearth can turn its engine on and off,
					but there will always be more engines firing and
					producing the change we need to move past the
					current binds we live under and into a realm of
					voluntaryism for all.
				</p>
				<p>
					When we create certain additional criteria for our
					interactions in addition to the NAP (which already
					underlies all of our interactions) we assure that
					our interactions will make the largest impact
					possible in the community that supports us.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					We need a community to support us in these ways:
					security, backups, community, etc. The everyday
					society we have come to know is not providing for
					us in the ways we need, and we are being led to
					erroneously think ourselves powerless over our
					current state of mass-human-enslavement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having a protected community requires vigilance,
					decentralization, sound principles, and a
					plurality of voluntary strategies aimed at meeting
					needs.

					Any action can be a good expenditure of time, but
					the person acting has to be self-aware of the
					action&rsquo;s context in the larger community.
					Most actions can be done in a way that leads
					toward the freedom we all seek.
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;In order to achieve anarchy, enough
					individuals must choose a lifestyle that makes
					freedom a more comfortable and easy choice for
					others while avoiding choices that perpetuate
					self-enslavement by making it easier or more
					comfortable for people to continue making
					lifestyle and purchasing decisions that perpetuate
					the continued existence of the State. No business
					built, family established, or garden tended will
					make the world more free if those things are not
					also done with the intention of making the choice
					of freedom for others more appealing than the
					&ldquo;statist-quo&rdquo;.
				</p>
				<p>
					The world today is not designed to make your path
					to freedom from government accessible, but rather
					to make the choice to surrender your freedom as
					easy and comfortable as possible. It is filled
					with institutions and ideologies designed to make
					freedom seem impossible in this lifetime and to
					make your time and wealth exploitable by people
					who thrive on your continued lack of freedom and
					lack of hope for such. Thinking that it's
					impossible to achieve freedom. Our job as
					freedom-bringers is to make the agorist path the
					path of least resistance for others. That is,
					freedom-bringers must create a world where freedom
					from taxation and regulation is as accessible as
					possible to others.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each individual can design their life to live with
					intention toward the maximization of freedom in
					this lifetime. This website aims to explore and
					facilitate various ways of life that will bring us
					as close as possible to anarchy in this lifetime.

					<h3>The Agorist Economic Advantage</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					<em
						>The worst evil is people still believing and
						perpetuating the lie that their neighbors must
						be controlled by the government. No individual
						or group of individuals can possess authority,
						or "the right to rule", over others. You own
						your self and 100% of the fruits of your time
						and labor, which can be thought of as an
						extension of yourself on this planet.</em
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					Our plan is to provide people with options to
					transfer their work and living situations into a
					new realm or state of existence where they are not
					bound by government systems of control. Your way
					of living should be an act of rebellion that helps
					make people’s choice for freedom a no-brainer.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are many ways in which this plan is unique
					to any we have seen so far. The unique attributes
					of our plan provide a strength and resilience that
					helps it transcend the pitfalls of other
					initiatives and businesses. Unlike a proposal that
					requires massive funding to get off the ground, we
					already have much of the infrastructure needed in
					place. All that is needed is to transition
					businesses that are funding the tax system into
					the new, free realm. There are no extra start up
					costs to create a business in the network - no
					fancy degrees or licenses are needed. Vending,
					selling, trading, and providing your good or
					service is free of compulsory licensure or fees.
					This initiative is aimed at people who are already
					trying to make a living and who already have
					resources invested in themselves and could benefit
					from shifting their business towards a tax-free
					network that will provide them with opportunities
					for growth, a greater sense of purpose and
					connection with their customers, and lasting
					prosperity.
				</p>
				<p>
					What we are describing is a lifestyle and
					resource-allocation strategy. The more people are
					empowered by these strategies, the stronger they
					become and the more everyone involved benefits.
					The success of the network is not tied to any
					individual’s success.
