        <h3>Self-Assessment for Living Free</h3>

        <p>
          <em
            >"The only way to deal with an unfree world is
            to become so absolutely free that your very
            existence is an act of rebellion."</em
          >
          — Albert Camus
        </p>
        <p>
          How free are you, really? This page presents a
          series of insightful prompts designed for deep
          self-assessment, inviting you to reflect on your
          identity, purpose, and actions within the context
          of a life lived in true liberty. These questions
          are imperative to getting the most out of your
          existence and amplifying yourself towards a truly
          free and fulfilling life, unburdened by external
          coercion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use these prompts periodically—perhaps quarterly
          or annually—to check your direction and ensure
          your daily actions align with your long-term
          freedom goals. There are no right answers, only
          honest self-examination.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>So... How Free Are You?</h2>
        <p>
          This is a self-assessment. Be brutally honest with
          yourself. The point isn't to feel bad about where
          you are—it's to identify where you want to go and
          what needs to change.
        </p>

          <h4>The Three Foundation Questions:</h4>

          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          These questions are imperative to getting the most
          out of your existence. Have you designed your life
          to fit your identity and what you're here to do?
          Or are you living someone else's plan?
        </p>

        <p>
          Here are more questions of self-reflection and
          self-change that you can go through to amplify
          yourself towards a more free (from government) and
          fulfilling life:

          We give scenarios to explain Voluntaryism. Do you
          get to move the goalposts? Or do your principles
          remain consistent regardless of the situation?
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Consistency Check:</h4>
          <p>
            Many people claim to believe in freedom but make
            exceptions when it's convenient or when they
            disagree with how others use their freedom. True
            principles don't have exceptions based on
            outcomes you like or dislike. They're consistent
            across all scenarios.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Do you support property rights only when you
              approve of how property is used?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do you support free speech only for speech you
              agree with?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do you support voluntary exchange except when
              you don't like what's being exchanged?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do you oppose violence except when it's for
              causes you support?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you answered yes to any of these, you don't
            actually hold those principles—you just use them
            when convenient.
