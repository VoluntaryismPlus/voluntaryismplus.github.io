					Our &ldquo;Ice Cream Philosophy&rdquo; is that we
					strive to bring to market the finest quality
					Homemade Ice Cream products, sourcing ingredients
					from as many agorist sources as possible, sourcing
					only the highest quality ingredients. <br /><br />
					This means no gums or perservatives, all organic
					ingredients (when possible), and raw heavy cream
					when we have a quality agorist source nearby.
					<br /><br />
					We are a private membership association and we
					pride ourselves on our handmade small-batch
					process to ensure the ice cream is fresh and
					customized to the occasion.
