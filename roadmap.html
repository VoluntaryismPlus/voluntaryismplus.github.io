									<img
										class="roadmap"

									<p>
										We are focusing on growing the wealth of
										everyone we can through agorism. Agorism
										is the practice of circumventing the
										State through counter-economics.

								<a href="1.2_IntroVoluntaryism.html"
									><h5>What is Voluntaryism?</h5>
									<img class="roadmap" src="img/12.jpeg" />
									<p>
										Voluntaryism is the moral philosophy
										that all forms of interaction should be
										voluntary, and that the only just use of
										force is defensive force. We abide by
										the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP) which
										dictates that no action be taken that
										violates another’s consent if not in
										self-defense.

								<a href="1.3_VoluntaryismPlus.html"
									><h5>Voluntaryism, Plus</h5>
									<img class="roadmap" src="img/13.jpeg" />
									<p>
										We are practicing voluntaryism with a
										twist. Voluntaryism plus intention. To
										get a more concise and potent result, we
										are more concise with our parameters.
										Those parameters are simply: are you
										making the world more free for just
										yourself? Or does your plan make the
										world more free for others as well?

										Anyone in the next 100 years could find
										this set of instructions and re-create
										what we are doing now. But there will be
										no need to start from scratch. As soon
										as the number of people are
										proliferating the ideas contained
										herein, there will be more aversions and
										more resiliency because of them.

			<h3>Love, Peace & Militia</h3><p>
A call for the disarmament of the government -and a call to arms for the militia which is the people
When should you shoot someone? How does the threat of equalizing force (death) affect how you treat others? When you know your intended victim is likely to respond with immediate lethal force if necessary to defend themselves, you’re not going to choose them as your victim over someone who relies on others to meet their need for safety or protection. If you rely on others to defend you, that isn’t wrong, but you should take your personal responsibility to defend yourself seriously.
Don’t be forced to subsidize others’ choices
Maximize your economic freedom to suit your needs, no matter how niche
No longer are there pant sizes everyone must wear. Wear clothes tailored to suit your unique self.
Customer, not subject
Voluntary response teams
Militia for community defense
Replace compulsive monopoly strategies with a plurality of market solutions to choose from
