									<p>
										Voluntaryism is the

										that all forms of
										interaction should
										be voluntary, and
										that the only just
										use of force is
										defensive force. We
										abide by the
										Non-Aggression
										Principle (NAP)

										that violates
										another’s consent if

					A Vocation for Van-lifers:
				</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				Currently, there is craigslist which
				provides basic search services for those
				wanting to buy or sell items. The bounty
				board is more complex and offers away for an
				individual to craft their own "job" out of
				providing for other people's weekly needs.
				Anyone who joins the network will be
				encouraged to post on the bounty board
				detailed descriptions of what goods and
				services they provide for themselves and
				purchase every week. These will be posted
				semi-anonymously on a map. From there,
				someone who is looking to start a new
				delivery route will be able to construct
				their delivery system based on the needs of
				those in their chosen area.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, if there were 10 people who
				would buy one dozen eggs per week but
				currently have to do it at the grocery store
				someone with a vehicle would be enabled to
				find a producer of eggs in the area who was
				able to produce 10 dozen eggs per week. If
				that person wasn’t already existent, the
				would-be egg deliverer could go to anyone
				and show them the demand, even gaining
				pre-orders from the people involved, and
				invest the small amount of money to get that
				delivery system up and running. People will
				be creating their own schedules, and
				negative experiences will be reported and
				dealt with seriously.
			</p>

			<p>
				When we go to an area, we stay there for a
				month. People in our caravan network with
				others in the town and raise awareness of
				our marketplace. Staying a month ensures
				that someone just introduced to agorism will
				have time to gain familiarity with our
				presence and is more likely to find the time
				to come to our market, which can be hosted
				constantly if those in the caravan desire to
				host it full-time.

				<h3>Directionality</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				<a
					href="1.3_VoluntaryismPlus.html#section1.4"
					>Directionality</a
				>
				will be discussed in the next chapter, but
				essentially it is a philosophical model like
				pragmatism that is based on creating
				positive conclusions and a positive course
				of action based on an assessment of the
				current information available. The method of
				conclusion, as well as the conclusion
				itself, can be updated as new information is
				synthesized. This allows for contracts and
				pluralistic norms that grow and evolve as
				time goes on and new information becomes
				available.
			</p>

		<div class="innersection">
			<div class="headerbox">
				<h2 id="section1.3">
					<strong
						>Directionality: Contractual
						Language, Islands Of Truth</strong
					>
				</h2>
			</div>
			<p>
				Directionality is a philosophy that can be
				described in simple terms: We are able to
				conceptualize and act upon the best possible
				model for our lives in each moment. We must
				be able to reassess our conclusions, as well
				as our methods for reaching conclusions,
				without losing the thread of reality or the
				ability to learn and grow from experience.
				Methods and conclusions are only stepping
				stones on the journey but no one stone can
				define the journey itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				Directionality creates temporary islands of
				truth for one to jump between. It prescribes
				each individual to use their own judgment to
				make conclusions, each containing its own
				temporary rules and prescritions.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>
				It makes sense to start one&rsquo;s
				philosophy from the assumption that this
				world is not a fake, projected
				&ldquo;matrix&rdquo; to be escaped from, but
				instead, that the best course of action is
				to assume that the world is something we can
				facilitate in embodying its best possible
				form. The current limitations will be
				transcended eventually, and with enough
				concerted effort in a positive direction,
				that eventuality should be able to come
				relatively soon.
			</p>
			<p>
				Directionality means there are islands of
				truth. Though we might not have the perfect
				grasp upon them, there are still real
				things/temporary facts that can be
				temporarily agreed upon and used as
				temporary variables in other discussions.
				The final truth to any one question does not
				need to be attained for there to be an
				agreed-upon temporary definition of one
				thing or another. If we use logical axioms
				and never stray into suppositions, there can

				With Directionality, you are using a higher
				order to organize how you recycle
				methodologies, holding a self-determined and
				clear goal as the highest priority around
				which you organize your decisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Directionality is about concluding the next
				course of action based on the currently
				known variables. The only worthwhile
				questions are those whose answer affects
				what we do with our lives. Directionality
				says the distinction is only necessary when
				it affects how you choose to act in the
				world. And I take that one step further, to
				say that the path to answering these deep
				questions should be guided by the comparable
				value of the outcome in your life each
				different answer would elicit.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you are trying to figure out the answer
				to deep questions, you should look to how
				each possible answer would affect your life
				- and choose the answer that gives you the
				best life.

			<p>
				The nihilist life-disaffirming ideologies
				currently fighting for purchase in the world
				cannot prevail if we replace vapid
				nothingness with purpose and meaning. Living
				our own lives can be fulfilling and
				life-changing for millions who will later
				join or support the cause we are
				presenting/spearheading here.

				<strong
					>How to move forward by holding onto
					values but not conclusions.</strong
				>
			</h4>
			<p>
				The person who thinks there is no way of
				determining the positive or negative value
				of anything has failed to recognize that any
				decision requires judgment. Life is a series
				of choices, and to choose implies you have
				made a judgment on at least one variable as
				being better or worse than another. The
				important thing to remember is that you do
				not need to hold onto that judgment
				indefinitely. You came to the conclusion
				based on your information and values at one
				point in time, but those must change as you
				gain more experiences.
			</p>
			<p>
				In life, it is good to be open to change,
				but the way it is done is important. In
				order to trust your own judgement, you must
				maintain an opinion on at least one thing
				while you change your mind on others.
				Holding to a current hypothesis, one can
				jump from old ground to new ground, able to
				leave previously used notions behind while
				maintaining continuity of mind.
			</p>
			<p>
				We must maintain a reference to at least one
				thing as we move from one lilypad of
				understanding to the next. But we do not
				need to retain loyalty to any thought or
				opinion any longer than it serves us.
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe we owe it to ourselves to do the
				best we can for that which we care about
				based on our current information and to
				constantly derive new ways of gaining and
				processing information.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is a fear some hold of judging
				something as good or bad. My philosophy
				allows for good and bad as they relate to
				real values like health and well-being. It
				is directedness, as a philosophy. It gives a
				way to imagine the best categorization of
				topics. Directionality does not limit
				reality but instead works with what is
				possible.
