      <h3>Building Trust Through Progressive Vetting</h3>

      
        <p>
          In a voluntary network operating outside state control, trust is paramount. But trust can't be given freely to strangers—it must be earned through demonstrated commitment to shared principles and proven track record of cooperation. The Admissions Portal provides a structured pathway for building trust within the Network, from initial contact to deep integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't gatekeeping for its own sake. It's a practical recognition that not everyone shares our values, and those who do must demonstrate their commitment through action, not just words. Progressive vetting protects the Network while providing clear pathways for newcomers to prove themselves.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Why Have an Admissions Portal?</h2>
        <p>
          Freedom doesn't mean naivety. A network built on trust requires mechanisms to establish that trust. The Admissions Portal serves several crucial functions:
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Purposes of Vetting:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Protect the Network:</strong> Filter out bad actors, infiltrators, and those who don't respect the NAP</li>
            <li><strong>Build confidence:</strong> Members can share sensitive information knowing others have been vetted</li>
            <li><strong>Demonstrate commitment:</strong> Actions speak louder than words—vetting requires investment of time and effort</li>
            <li><strong>Create appropriate access:</strong> Not everyone needs (or should have) access to everything</li>
            <li><strong>Establish reputation:</strong> Progressive levels create visible track record of trustworthiness</li>
            <li><strong>Enable coordination:</strong> Knowing who's vetted to what level helps organize activities</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          The goal isn't exclusion—it's appropriate inclusion. Everyone starts somewhere, and clear vetting paths show exactly how to progress.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>What's Inside the Network?</h2>
        <p>
          The Network operates on tiered access. Some information and spaces are public, available to anyone curious about voluntaryism. Other areas require demonstrated commitment and trust.
        </p>

        <h3>Public Access (No Vetting Required)</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The Library:</strong> Philosophy, examples, educational content—freely available to all</li>
            <li><strong>Workshop basics:</strong> Getting Started guides, foundational tactics</li>
            <li><strong>General events:</strong> Public meetups, open festivals, educational gatherings</li>
            <li><strong>Introduction materials:</strong> What the Network is, how it works, why it matters</li>
            <li><strong>Public Agora:</strong> General marketplace listings visible to all</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Member Access (Basic Vetting)</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Full Marketplace:</strong> Complete access to goods, services, bounties</li>
            <li><strong>Network Directory:</strong> Contact information for vetted members</li>
            <li><strong>Guild information:</strong> Details on joining and participating in Guilds</li>
            <li><strong>Host networks:</strong> Access to Network Host properties and locations</li>
            <li><strong>Communication channels:</strong> Encrypted group chats, coordination tools</li>
            <li><strong>Member meetups:</strong> Private gatherings for vetted individuals</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Advanced Access (Higher Vetting Levels)</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sensitive locations:</strong> Addresses of private properties, hidden havens</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Workshop content:</strong> Detailed tactical guides for counter-economics</li>
            <li><strong>Inner circles:</strong> Private discussion groups for strategy and planning</li>
            <li><strong>Security-critical information:</strong> Coordination for collective defense</li>
            <li><strong>Financial networks:</strong> Private lending circles, investment opportunities</li>
            <li><strong>Deep integration:</strong> Living on Network properties, core team participation</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>How to Pass Through: The Vetting Process</h2>
        <p>
          There are multiple layers of vetting, and there may be more layers added as people create new requirements. The basic progression moves from philosophical alignment, to demonstrated action, to deep trust built over time.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1: Show Comprehension and Agreement</h3>
        <p>
          The foundation is understanding and accepting the Non-Aggression Principle. You can't participate in a voluntary network if you believe some people have rights others don't.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Initial Requirements:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Demonstrate understanding of the NAP and voluntaryist philosophy</li>
            <li>Explicitly agree to the NAP in all your interactions within the Network</li>
            <li>Show you've engaged with Library content (philosophy pages, examples)</li>
            <li>Complete basic orientation—understand what the Network is and isn't</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: Create an Account</h3>
        <p>
          Initial registration establishes your identity within the Network. This can be as anonymous or transparent as you choose, but you need some consistent identity for building reputation.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Account Creation:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Choose your level of anonymity (pseudonymous or real name)</li>
            <li>Establish secure communication methods (encrypted email, Signal, etc.)</li>
            <li>Indicate your interests, skills, and what you're looking for in the Network</li>
            <li>Accept community guidelines and commitment to peaceful interaction</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 3: Initial Participation</h3>
        <p>
          Actions matter more than words. Initial vetting involves low-risk participation that demonstrates your values align with the Network's.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Ways to Demonstrate Commitment:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Attend public meetups and engage constructively</li>
            <li>Complete trades on the Marketplace (start small, build reputation)</li>
            <li>Contribute to public discussions with helpful, NAP-consistent input</li>
            <li>Share your skills or resources through bounty completion</li>
            <li>Show up when you say you will—reliability matters</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 4: Sponsorship and Vouching</h3>
        <p>
          Higher levels of access require existing members to vouch for you. This creates accountability—they're putting their reputation on the line for yours.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Sponsorship Process:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Build relationships with existing members through participation</li>
            <li>Ask trusted members to sponsor your progression to higher levels</li>
            <li>Sponsors verify your character and commitment through direct interaction</li>
            <li>Multiple sponsors may be required for sensitive access levels</li>
            <li>Sponsors share responsibility for your behavior—strong incentive to choose wisely</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="outerimage">
        <img src="img/admissions3.jpg" />
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Vetting Levels</h2>
        <p>
          Here outlined are the steps that can be taken in order to join the inner realm of the network. These levels aren't rigid bureaucracy—they're organic trust building formalized into visible progression.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Examples of Vetting Levels</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Level 1: Observer</strong> - Public access, reading materials, attending open events</li>
            <li><strong>Level 2: Participant</strong> - Basic member access, Marketplace use, general communication channels</li>
            <li><strong>Level 3: Contributor</strong> - Active participation, Guild membership, some location access</li>
            <li><strong>Level 4: Trusted Member</strong> - Deep integration, sensitive information, core activities</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          <em>Note: Specific vetting levels and requirements may vary by region, Guild, or community within the larger Network. The above are general guidelines.</em>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Multiple Pathways to Trust</h2>
        <p>
          There are several different paths that can be taken to achieve a new level of vetting. Not everyone enters the Network the same way, and different paths demonstrate different types of trustworthiness.
        </p>

        <h3 id="network">Network Hosts</h3>
        <p>
          Visiting and staying at Network Host properties is one of the fastest ways to build trust. Hosts directly vet guests through extended interaction.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Host Vetting Path:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Initial contact through Network directory or referral</li>
            <li>Short visit to meet host and learn about property</li>
            <li>Longer stays demonstrate compatibility and reliability</li>
            <li>Work-trade opportunities prove commitment and work ethic</li>
            <li>Hosts can vouch for guests to other parts of the Network</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 id="agorist">Agorist Hosts</h3>
        <p>
          Agorist Hosts specifically focus on counter-economic activity. Staying with them and participating in their businesses demonstrates practical commitment to agorism, not just philosophical agreement.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Agorist Host Vetting:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Participation in counter-economic activities</li>
            <li>Learning agorist business practices</li>
            <li>Contributing to host's operations</li>
            <li>Developing your own agorist income streams</li>
            <li>Building reputation through trade within host's network</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 id="caravan">CaravAnarchy</h3>
        <p>
          Joining the traveling caravan provides intensive vetting through close-quarters living and collaborative work. You can't fake commitment when you're living and working together daily.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Caravan Vetting Path:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Initial meeting at caravan location or event</li>
            <li>Short-term travel to assess compatibility</li>
            <li>Longer-term membership proves reliability and cooperation</li>
            <li>Contributing to caravan operations and businesses</li>
            <li>Building relationships with multiple caravan members</li>

        <h3>Guild Membership</h3>
        <p>
          Joining a <a href="4_guilds.html">Guild</a> provides vetting through skill development and professional reputation. Guilds establish their own internal vetting processes.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Guild Vetting Path:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Attend Guild events and workshops</li>
            <li>Complete apprenticeship or training programs</li>
            <li>Demonstrate skill competency</li>
            <li>Build reputation through quality work</li>
            <li>Guild masters vouch for proven members</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Marketplace Reputation</h3>
        <p>
          Building reputation through successful trades and completed bounties demonstrates trustworthiness through economic interaction.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Marketplace Vetting Path:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Start with small, low-risk transactions</li>
            <li>Complete bounties and fulfill commitments</li>
            <li>Accumulate positive reviews and ratings</li>
            <li>Develop track record of fair dealing</li>
            <li>Economic reputation translates to social trust</li>

      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <h2>Maintaining and Losing Trust</h2>
        <p>
          Vetting isn't a one-time achievement—it's ongoing. Trust must be maintained through consistent NAP-compliant behavior. And it can be lost through violations.
        </p>

        <h3>Maintaining Your Level</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li>Continue active participation—dormant accounts may require re-vetting</li>
            <li>Honor all agreements and commitments</li>
            <li>Respect others' property and boundaries</li>
            <li>Contribute positively to Network activities</li>
            <li>Maintain good standing with sponsors and vouchers</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Losing Access</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Violations That Can Result in De-vetting:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>NAP violations:</strong> Initiating force, fraud, theft against other members</li>
            <li><strong>Betrayal of trust:</strong> Sharing sensitive information inappropriately</li>
            <li><strong>Infiltration/bad faith:</strong> Evidence you joined to harm the Network</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent unreliability:</strong> Pattern of broken commitments</li>
            <li><strong>Sponsor withdrawal:</strong> If sponsors retract their vouching due to your behavior</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          The good news: even if you lose trust, you can rebuild it. The path back may be longer and require more proof, but redemption is possible through demonstrated changed behavior.
        </p>
      </div>

        <p>
          Ready to begin your vetting journey? Here's your roadmap:
        </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Make your first trade:</strong> Complete a small transaction on the Marketplace to build initial reputation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Find your pathway:</strong> Choose Host visits, Caravan participation, Guild membership, or multiple paths.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Build relationships:</strong> Trust comes from repeated positive interactions over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Be patient:</strong> Rushing trust is suspicious. Let it develop naturally through consistent behavior.
