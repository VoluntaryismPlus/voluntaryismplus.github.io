	<h2 id="section1"><strong><em>We are voluntaryists plus discretion. Agorists with urgency.</em></strong></h2>
	<p>We are practicing voluntaryism with a twist. Voluntaryism plus intention. To get a more concise and potent result, we are more concise with our parameters. Those parameters are simply: are you making the world more free for just yourself? Or does your plan make the world more free for others as well?
	We are not judging those who do not follow these parameters, but we are making a distinction within our own decisions. We will prioritize doing business with those who share a similar requirement in their vision.</p>
	<p>Does one's strong preference for voluntaryism over statism necessarily make them a full-blown voluntaryist, even while their lifestyle design serves as a perpetual boon to the State? Freedom will not be granted to you. It can be had, but must be taken.</p>
	<p>Look to where your resources flow. How far does your dollar go? How many hops before draining back into the state? The people you sell to and do business with - are they bolstering all of our futures with their time, energy, and focus? Or is it being wasted on endeavors that ultimately entangle their existences with the state, bolstering it while our own support networks are getting starved out? Once you have taken care of your own basic needs, where does the excess go? What are you choosing to do with your life, and who is that benefitting?</p>
	<p>Free Markets are at (economic) war with un-Free Markets. If you are a producer or provider of a good or service, are you spending your time adding value to the lives of people who seek freedom from the State and its extortive impositions? If not, which side of the economic war are you fighting on? How much of what you earn goes into the hands of the enemy, the State, and all who support the destruction of freedom? How much of your is spent making the free-market choice superior to the un-Free market choices that that fund the war-machine and mass-incarceration of human beings?</p>
	<p>We favor business with people who align with our pro-liberty and anti-government and anti-taxation and pro-free-market ideals. Those are the kinds of folk we want to spend our time serving, and whom we will go out of our way to ensure customer satisfaction with. That said, if someone doesn't align with us in one or more of those ways, but still happens to enjoy a good or service we provide, we are still glad they got to try out that small taste of what agorism and the free market can provide.</p>
	<div class="headerbox"><h3 id="section1.1"><strong>Essential Functions and Strengths of Voluntaryism +</strong></h3></div>
	<p>We define clear goals for our interactions and steps towards achieving a freer way of life. When you choose to adopt voluntaryism plus, you can look to this guide to expand on what you already know you can do.</p>

	<div class="headerbox"><h2 id="section2"><strong><em>Criteria for Engagement</em></strong></h2></div>
	<h4><em>For Individuals, Intention is the Criteria</em></h4>
	<p>One reaction to being born into a world where you are under attack is to seek an isolated existence in which you put all your effort into your own survival and bettering a few people around you in small ways. There is a natural and rational fear that any individual can have of putting their survival into the hands of other people. At the same time, certain commodities cannot be made locally and have to be outsourced. Aside from a primitivist society, the self-sufficiency of a network is deepened through its access to different types of connections, anonymized and protected as needed by pgp.</p>
	<p>When the issue of personal privacy and security is taken care of, you can look to grow your network in ways that serve you far greater than is currently possible and offer you a type of physical insurance and security that is not available to many people in this world.</p>
	<p>Intention means everything. If your intention is to serve yourself to the fullest extent, are you open to ways do you also consider that your world would improve far more the more connections you allowed to serve the extended version of the network?</p>
	<p>To put it simply, we are looking for people who are both enabling themselves to be completely free of the government and enabling others to be free. But there are several ways we define this for clarification purposes:</p>
	<p>Every individual or group we work with:</p>
		<div class="callout">
			<div class="callouttext">
				<ul>
					<li>Follows the NAP (non-agression principle).</li>
					<li>Understands our plan towards a voluntaryist society.</li>
					<li>Has their own plan toward a voluntaryist life for all that extends beyond their own survival.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
	</div>
	<p>A business plan in itself will not create a voluntaryist society. A business plan that supports itself does nothing more than float a ship on a sea that is falsely claimed as property by the State.</p>
	<br><div class="headerbox"><h4 id="section2.2"><em>For Communities, Conflict Resolution is the Criteria</em></h4></div>
	<p>We try to mirror the pluralist society as much as we can and allow for ingenuity to guide the shape of the network as it develops over time. However, there are certain constraints we do make to form our structures on positive axioms. So while there do not need to be rules that restrict others from In every community, there is always a method for what happens when there is conflict. What we want is to encourage communities that make it clear the exact method of conflict resolution they unanimously agree to employ. For each person who is looking to be connected to a community, it serves the individual to have an understanding and agree to the arbitration to be employed if there is a dispute within the community.</p>
	<p>If there are public spaces, there will be disputes in which two parties are both seeking to remain in the group for various reasons.</p>
