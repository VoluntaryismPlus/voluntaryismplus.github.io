          <h3>The Trap You're Escaping</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Traditional wealth-building is designed to keep you dependent. Get a job, pay taxes, save in their currency, invest in their markets, retire on their timeline. Every step requires permission, feeds the state, and leaves you vulnerable to their rules changing overnight.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Wealth Path is about building prosperity outside this system. Counter-economic wealth means earning, saving, and growing value through voluntary exchange—no state extraction, no permission required, no dependence on institutions that don't serve your interests.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <div class="headerbox">
          <h3>What Counter-Economic Wealth Actually Looks Like</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          It's not just about making money. It's about creating value streams that can't be taxed, seized, or regulated away. This means:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Income outside the system:</strong> Cash businesses, cryptocurrency, barter, precious metals—exchanges the state can't track or tax</li>
            <li><strong>Skills that travel:</strong> Abilities you can monetize anywhere, without needing licenses or institutional approval</li>
            <li><strong>Assets that hold value:</strong> Physical goods, land, tools, silver and gold—things that retain worth regardless of state currency manipulation</li>
            <li><strong>Networks over institutions:</strong> Trading relationships with real people, not dependence on banks, employers, or government programs</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <div class="headerbox">
          <h3>Your Starting Points</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          You don't need to master everything at once. Pick one or two approaches that fit your current situation and start building from there.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h3>1. Start Trading in the Counter-Economy</h3>
        <p>
          The fastest way to build counter-economic wealth is to start participating in it. The <a href="6_bountyboard.html">Bounty Board</a> in <a href="6_agora.html">The Agora</a> connects you with people who need goods and services right now. Post what you offer, take on bounties that match your skills, and start earning outside the tax system.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Immediate action:</strong> Visit the Bounty Board today. Look at what people are requesting. Can you fulfill any of those needs? Post your own offer—even something simple like "will help you move for $50 cash" or "homemade bread, $5 per loaf, silver accepted."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h3>2. Develop Mobile Skills</h3>
        <p>
          The most valuable skills in a free economy are ones you can practice anywhere, without needing institutional permission or expensive infrastructure. These skills travel with you and can't be regulated away.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <h4>High-Value Mobile Professions:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Craftspeople:</strong> Leather work, metalworking, woodworking, jewelry</li>
            <li><strong>Food vendors:</strong> Baking, cooking, brewing, specialty foods</li>
            <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Mechanics, electricians, plumbers, repair specialists</li>
            <li><strong>Body workers:</strong> Massage, personal training, barbers, tattoo artists</li>
            <li><strong>Educators & speakers:</strong> Teaching skills, consulting, workshops</li>
            <li><strong>Performers:</strong> Musicians, storytellers, entertainers</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          If you don't have mobile skills yet, use <a href="4_workshop.html">The Workshop</a> to learn. Join a <a href="4_guilds.html">Guild</a> to get mentored by people already doing this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Immediate action:</strong> List three skills you have right now that could be monetized without needing a license, degree, or employer. If you can't think of any, choose one mobile skill you want to learn and find someone in the Network who can teach you.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h3>3. Protect Your Wealth with Real Assets</h3>
        <p>
          State currency loses value by design. Build wealth in things that hold value regardless of what governments do: precious metals (silver and gold), land, tools, tradeable goods, and skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start converting income into physical assets as quickly as possible. Even small amounts add up—an ounce of silver here, quality tools there, storable food, useful equipment. These aren't just savings; they're insurance against currency collapse and assets you can trade directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Immediate action:</strong> This week, convert some cash into silver or a tangible asset you can use or trade. Start small if you need to, but start.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h3>4. Build Trading Networks</h3>
        <p>
          Wealth in the counter-economy isn't just about what you own—it's about who you can trade with. The more people you know who produce valuable goods and services, the more resilient your economic position becomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the <a href="5_connect.html">Gathering Hall</a> to connect with Network members in your area. Attend events listed in <a href="7_events.html">The Agora's Events section</a>.

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Immediate action:</strong> Identify three people in your area who produce something you regularly need. Reach out and establish a direct trading relationship—pay them in cash, silver, or barter to cut out the middleman.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h3>5. Create Your Own Income Streams</h3>
        <p>
          Stop waiting for permission to make money. Start a cash business, offer a service, create a product, organize a market. The counter-economy rewards people who take initiative and solve problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider joining or starting a nomadic market or caravan (learn more at <a href="4_caravans.html">Nomadic Markets & Caravans</a>). These mobile marketplaces bring buyers and sellers together outside state-controlled venues, creating wealth opportunities for everyone involved.

          The Wealth Path isn't about getting rich in the state's system—it's about building prosperity that can't be taken from you. Start with one concrete action this week: post on the Bounty Board, convert some cash to silver, learn a mobile skill, or reach out to one person for a direct trade relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Real wealth is built step by step, trade by trade, relationship by relationship. You don't need permission to begin. You just need to start.
