          Voluntaryists adhere to a philosophy based on the
          idea that all human interactions should be
          voluntary. If you take those ideas to their
          conclusion, you are an anarchist. The world we
          envision includes voluntary relations between
          equals, rather than between rulers and subjects.
        </p>
        <div class="headerbox">
          <h4>
            <em>Without rulers. Not without rules.</em>
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          Anarchy is about individuals deciding for
          themselves how they will interact with the world.
          This does not mean they will be able to oppress or
          aggress upon others without repercussions.
          Voluntaryism is Anarchy because property rights
          and self-ownership are immutable but do not ever
          necessitate coercion or force such as telling
          others what they can and can&rsquo;t do with their
          property. In the current system, do you feel like
          you have control? In a voluntaryist world, there
          is no legal way to aggress against others, and you
          are free to determine the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; over
          your own property.
        </p>
        <p>
          We define evil as the destruction of freedom. A
          choice for the lesser of two evils is still a
          choice for evil and will always result in evil.
          You never have to choose evil. Just like the
          trajectory of all evil is more evil, the
          trajectory of all tyrants, both big and small, is
          more tyranny. The ends don&rsquo;t justify the
          means. The means and the end are the same. Freedom
          must be taken.

        <p>
          Decisions are best made by the people who are
          affected by a decision. There are no &ldquo;one
          size fits all&rdquo; solutions that work best for
          most people. Such &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; are
          usually only made possible through compulsion. The
          best solution for everyone seeking a voluntary and
          peaceful world is to resist and refuse
          involuntary, compulsive strategies while being
          tolerant and supportive (or at the very least not
          opposed to) societies consisting of only
          pluralities of competing voluntary peaceful
          offerings and solutions to meet the needs of
          individuals.

        <p>
          I don't have to explain how anything will/would
          work. If you wish to use force or coercion against
          others, <em>you</em> have the burden-of-proof for
          why. I don't have to prove why I should not be
          robbed, raped, assaulted, kidnapped, etc.

          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Most of us are already Voluntaryists and we all
          already live in a state of anarchy. We live in
          anarchy now. We define having
          &ldquo;authority&rdquo; as having power over and
          the right to exercise that power over someone or
          something. There is no such thing as authority
          beyond the self because no one has the right to
          exercise their will against another&rsquo;s will.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are free to act as we like. The game of rulers
          and subjects is just a story we tell ourselves. We
          are hindered by the people called the police force
          (see our section on voluntary means of
          defense).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We can become more free from government bullying
          by building alternate networks of free people.
          &ldquo;Government/<em>the state</em>&rdquo; is the
          belief that some people can possess authority
          (power and the right to exercise it) over other
          people. The belief that some of us are rulers
          while the rest of us are subjects and must obey is
          a story people tell themselves. Some people stand
          up and defy tyrants. Luckily, resisting tyranny
          does not require violence or aggression.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are providing opportunities and options so that
          people don&rsquo;t have to seek services that the
          proceeds from are going towards the government and
          people who also drain their resources to the
          government; granting them lesser autonomy<em>
            and the perpetuation of the under-supplied
            agorist market.</em

        <h3>Embracing the Parallel Economy (Agorism):</h3>
        <p>
          We believe in actively building the free society
          within the shell of the old through the creation
          and growth of the parallel economy. By engaging in
          voluntary exchange, offering goods and services
          outside of state control, and fostering
          decentralized markets, we directly undermine the
          power of the coercive system and create tangible
          pathways to freedom and prosperity for individuals
          right now. Our focus is on building real
          alternatives, not just protesting the existing
          order.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Practical Action & Real-World Solutions:</h3>
        <p>
          Our philosophy is not confined to abstract ideals.
          We are committed to taking practical action and
          developing real-world solutions to the challenges
          individuals face in navigating and transcending
          the current system. From establishing nomadic
          communities and facilitating decentralized
          marketplaces to fostering skills-sharing and
          mutual aid networks, we prioritize tangible
          strategies that empower people to live more freely
          and resiliently in their daily lives, wherever they are located.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Continuous Learning & Adaptation:</h3>
        <p>
          The path to freedom is not static. We embrace a
          mindset of continuous learning, critical
          self-reflection, and adaptation. We are committed
          to exploring new ideas, refining our strategies,
          and evolving our approaches based on real-world
          experience and the insights of our community. This
          ongoing process of learning and adaptation is
          essential for building a truly resilient and
          thriving free society.
