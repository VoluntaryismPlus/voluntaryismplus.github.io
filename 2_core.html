      <h1>Our Core Principles</h1>
      
      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <p>
          These principles form the ethical foundation of everything we do. They're not abstract philosophy—they're practical rules that make free society possible. Whether you're trading in the Agora, staying with a network host, or traveling with a caravan, these principles guide every interaction.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- PRINCIPLE 1: VOLUNTARY INTERACTION -->
      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <div class="headerbox">
          <h2>Voluntary Interaction Only</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          All human interactions should be voluntary. Period. This isn't complicated. If you take this idea to its logical conclusion, you're an anarchist. The world we're building has voluntary relations between equals—not between rulers and subjects.
        </p>
        
        <div class="headerbox">
          <h4><em>Without rulers. Not without rules.</em></h4>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          Anarchy means individuals decide for themselves how to interact with the world. It doesn't mean you can aggress against others without consequences. Voluntaryism works because property rights and self-ownership are real—but they never justify coercion or telling others what to do with their property.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In the current system, do you feel like you have control? In a voluntaryist world, there's no legal way to aggress against others, and you're free to determine the rules over your own property.
        </p>
        
        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>The Non-Aggression Principle (NAP)</strong></p>
          <p>
            No person or group may initiate force or fraud against another person or their property. Self-defense is always legitimate. Restitution (not punishment) is how justice works.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="outerimage">
        <img src="img/network.jpeg" alt="Decentralized Network" />
      </div>

      <!-- PRINCIPLE 2: DECENTRALIZATION -->
      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <div class="headerbox">
          <h2>Decentralization</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Decisions are best made by the people affected by them. There are no "one size fits all" solutions that work for most people. Those kinds of "solutions" only exist through compulsion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best path for everyone seeking a voluntary and peaceful world is to refuse involuntary, compulsive strategies while supporting (or at least not opposing) societies built on competing voluntary offerings that meet individual needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why we don't have a central authority. This is why caravans move independently. This is why hosts set their own terms. Decentralization isn't a bug—it's the feature that keeps us resilient.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="outerimage">
        <img src="img/decent1.jpeg" alt="Decentralized Community" />
      </div>

      <!-- PRINCIPLE 3: MORAL CLARITY -->
      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <div class="headerbox">
          <h2>Moral Philosophy Over Political Philosophy</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          We don't have to explain how every detail of society "would work" without a state. That's not our burden. If you want to use force or coercion against others, <em>you</em> have the burden of proof for why.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't have to prove why we shouldn't be robbed, assaulted, or kidnapped. The burden is on those who want to initiate force to justify it. They can't.
        </p>
        
        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>Evil is the destruction of freedom.</strong></p>
          <p>
            A choice for the lesser of two evils is still a choice for evil and will always result in evil. You never have to choose evil. The trajectory of all evil is more evil. The trajectory of all tyrants is more tyranny. The ends don't justify the means. The means and the end are the same.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Freedom must be taken.</strong></p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- PRINCIPLE 4: WE ALREADY LIVE IN ANARCHY -->
      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <div class="headerbox">
          <h2>We Already Live in Anarchy</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Most of us are already voluntaryists. We all already live in a state of anarchy right now. Authority doesn't exist. It's a story.
        </p>
        <p>
          We define "authority" as having power over someone and the right to exercise that power. But no one has that right. No one can exercise their will against another person's will legitimately. Authority beyond the self is fiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're free to act as we like. The game of rulers and subjects is just a story we tell ourselves. We're hindered by people called "police," but they have no more legitimate authority than anyone else. They're just people who believe the story.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can become more free from government bullying by building alternate networks of free people. The state is just a belief—the belief that some people can possess authority over others. That belief is false. Some people stand up and defy tyrants. Resisting tyranny doesn't require violence or aggression. It just requires refusing to participate in the lie.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- PRINCIPLE 5: PARALLEL ECONOMY -->
      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <div class="headerbox">
          <h2>Building the Parallel Economy</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          We believe in actively building the free society within the shell of the old. This isn't metaphorical. We're creating actual marketplaces, trade networks, and community infrastructure outside state control.
        </p>
        <p>
          By engaging in voluntary exchange, offering goods and services outside state control, and fostering decentralized markets, we directly undermine the coercive system and create tangible pathways to freedom and prosperity right now. Our focus is on building real alternatives, not protesting the existing order.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you buy from Chew's Wisely instead of a corporate chain, you're participating in the parallel economy. When you trade silver for goods at a festival, you're participating. When you stay with a network host instead of paying a landlord, you're participating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every transaction outside the system is a small act of secession.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- PRINCIPLE 6: PRACTICAL ACTION -->
      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <div class="headerbox">
          <h2>Practical Action & Real Solutions</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Our philosophy isn't confined to abstract ideals. We're committed to taking practical action and developing real-world solutions to the challenges individuals face in navigating and transcending the current system.
        </p>
        <p>
          From establishing nomadic communities and facilitating decentralized marketplaces to fostering skills-sharing and mutual aid networks, we prioritize tangible strategies that empower people to live more freely and resiliently in their daily lives, wherever they're located.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why Camp Orientation focuses on the four pathways. This is why The Workshop contains practical guides. This is why The Agora exists. Philosophy without action is just theory. We're interested in results.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- PRINCIPLE 7: CONTINUOUS ADAPTATION -->
      <div class="innersection panel stack">
        <div class="headerbox">
          <h2>Continuous Learning & Adaptation</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          The path to freedom isn't static. We embrace continuous learning, critical self-reflection, and adaptation. We're committed to exploring new ideas, refining our strategies, and evolving our approaches based on real-world experience and the insights of our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          This ongoing process of learning and adaptation is essential for building a truly resilient and thriving free society. We don't have all the answers. We're figuring it out as we go—together.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why guilds exist. That's why we encourage movement between different roles and locations. That's why this website keeps evolving. Static systems become brittle. Adaptive systems survive.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- SUMMARY -->
      <div class="innersection panel stack">

          <h2>Putting Principles Into Practice</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          These principles aren't just philosophy—they're the operating system for everything we do. When you understand them, you understand why we organize the way we do. When you live by them, you become part of the solution.
