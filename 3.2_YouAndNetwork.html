						<strong>The Road to the Top</strong>

				</div>
				<p>
					To become the person we want to be, we will go
					through a complex combination of steps including
					steps of healing, remembering, dreaming,
					regrouping, feeling lost, feeling angry, and then
					coming back again and again to what it is that
					drives you.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					It&rsquo;s not too hard to opt-out if you have
					enough support. And this network is providing the
					extra support needed to those who don&rsquo;t
					already have a network, just as we all do when we
					are starting something.

				</div>
				<p>
					Do you ever fantasize about a world in which
					restrictions currently in place don&rsquo;t hinder
					you at every turn? Do you have a &ldquo;realistic
					plan&rdquo; and yet also an idea for how much
					greater your impact would be if there was just
					more freedom in the world? We are on the path to
					the creation of that world today. We achieve this
					by continuing to act as free and sovereign
					individuals while broadening our network so that
					we can begin to see the results of our efforts to
					make the world a better and safer place for future
					generations.

				<p>
					Imagine a world with only voluntary interactions.
					It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that every claim to
					authority ever feigned could easily be shown to be
					completely falsified, but it is just that simple.
					You cannot prove that you have authority over

					<h4>The most valuable resource</h4>
				</div>
				<p>
					The goal is to become aware of which areas you
					want to advance in your life to maximize your
					machine and thus your effect on freedom
					everywhere.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our own energy and attention are our most
					ill-utilized resources. Our own worth is used
					frivolously, starting from the levels of
					government indoctrination centers many attend from
					a young age. Even simpler than this is the fact
					that humans are told that they are in debt since
					birth, racking up carbon footprint murder points
					for making simple self-care choices like taking a
					shower for longer than 5 minutes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not only do we, as humans, provide essential
					nutrients to the ground, but the breath we exhale
					is all in perfect alignment with the world around
					us. We propagate new crops and create paths and
					shelter that can be utilized by other creatures
					when we are gone. Never once do we step outside of
					line with this harmony until we promote those
					things that restrict and limit human free will and
					ingenuity. (destruction of freedom) We value
					humans who overcome these restrictions.

					<h2 id="section2.1">What We Value</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					Most of all, we value voluntaryists (people who
					follow the ZAP) who wish to manifest freedom
					beyond just themselves and their own situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also value individuals who wish to circumvent
					the &ldquo;state&rdquo; through counter-economics
					(a.k.a Agorism) that take measures to prevent
					their wealth, once exchanged for other things of
					value, from landing in the hands of evil
					people.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<h3 id="section2.2">
					<strong>Get Involved Today</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					For those who want to get involved but don&rsquo;t
					know how that would look, you don&rsquo;t have to
					go far. We are creating meetups in every city
					along our trade route. Soon, you will go to
					voluntaryist events in a rotation of cities or go
					to one in your hometown.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are ready to leave your situation today,
					the caravan is the most immediate form of aid. We
					have 5 vehicles and the mobile camping
					infrastructure setup available where we can share
					resources in a loose, slow-moving caravan with the
					aim of ending slavery today through education,
					agorism, and encouraging the connection between
					new and already made alternative networks.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want a stationary option, there are many
					agorist locations that will help you along the
					path towards freedom. These are listed in Chapter
					3, Transcending Location.

						<h3>
							<strong>Creating a New World</strong>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						The character classes we were presented with in
						the current world are flawed. We were born into
						a world corrupted with prevalent lies such as
						the existence of &ldquo;authority over
						others&rdquo;. Most of us, in order to become
						successful and remain &ldquo;legal&rdquo; (aka
						&ldquo;politician-approved&rdquo;) in the eyes
						of the government, require expensive licenses,
						taxes, and other advertising barriers that make
						it hard to succeed in the modern world.
					</p>
					<p>
						Following in the footsteps of the generations
						before us, the new generation is already
						eschewing the lie of secondary education. It is
						very mainstream now to hear stories of people
						succeeding without a college degree or tons of
						money to start off with. But the stories we hear
						are of people who succeeded
						<em>despite</em> the landmines thrown into their
						path by the government that is supposed to be
						serving them.
					</p>
					<p>
						Robin Hood aside, stories about people who live
						completely outside of the bounds of governmental
						restrictions are often told in the form of
						horror stories and usually have a bad ending. We
						are told to fear being cast out by society and
						that the only way to really survive is to obey
						every law that is decided for us by unknown
						individuals under the guise of our fellow man.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fear leads many into hiding and seeking absolute
						isolation in response to knowledge of the
						reality of the world right now.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="innersection">
					<div class="headerbox">
						<h3>Create Your Character Class</h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						Everyone has their own unique combination of
						skills and interests, and each person's
						character class will be something that they
						discover over time, and name, if they choose.
						Any title is just a snapshot, only approximating
						a description of the whole person who is always
						growing and updating their own understanding of
						themselves and what they are here to do.
					</p>
					<p>
						Choosing a vocation does not have to be so
						expensive and take such a long time before a
						person can even start practicing their trade.
						Apprenticeships are all but nonexistent in most
						fields because of the current system but can be
						a great way for a person to make a small living
						while learning whether they would like to pursue
						a craft further.
					</p>
					<p>
						Everyone deserves some time to detox from
						society and decide what they would be doing with
						their lives if they really had the freedom to
						create a life they wanted to live. This.
						Involves trying their hand at different skills
						and living in different environments. It also
						includes and requires a detox from the nervous
						system fake out which is the modern-day
						measuring stick of success in the cities of

				<h4>a lifestyle maximized for freedom.</h4>
				<p>
					Whatever roles you want to play in the world,
					short or long-term, you are capable of creating
					the best plan for how those roles will be played
					out. You may want to learn from others for a time,
					but eventually, you will trust your own expertise
					on the subject and will be the one best suited to
					the task of planning your method and approach.
				</p>
				<p>
					The current system has us doing all kinds of
					acrobatics with licenses, restrictions, and taxes
					that create bars to entry in most major
					industries. We have the power to step away from
					these issues, but we need to also have a market to
					step into - a demand for our services. That is the
					purpose of the network. You can create a new name
					for your profession or just a new description of
					the possibilities within it.
				</p>
				<p>
					The network we are working on opposes the idea of
					keeping a profession that funds the state.
					That&rsquo;s why we are working to expand the
					number of jobs available within the network that
					meet these criteria: they do not fund the state or
					people who fund the state. Eventually, this will
					look like all participants in all transactions not
					funding the state with their shelter, job, food,
					or leisure activities.

						<strong>The Inhumanity of Modern Work</strong>

				</div>

				<p>
					The system is rigged so that we can&rsquo;t spend
					our time in a way that is constantly bettering our
					situation. In order to better our situation, we
					must get a job. But a job is stagnant - in
					general, it does not allow you to constantly
					innovate how you spend your time and how the job
					works. Not only do jobs promote stagnant time in
					our day, but a person must be perceived as stable
					to get most jobs.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					A job in itself is not bad. But the common
					understanding of a job is tied to a common
					understanding of the world - in which all commerce
					must be tied to the state under threat of
					punishment. It is rare that the actual time and
					activities spent in a day align with a
					person&rsquo;s ideal working environment. We may
					earn wealth, but what we are doing to grow
					ourselves toward our greater selves is often
					limited if we choose to seek money over spending
					time growing ourselves in other ways.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the current paradigm, we can&rsquo;t easily
					spend our time in a way that is constantly
					bettering our situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to better our situation, we must get a
					job. But a job is stagnant - in general, it does
					not allow you to constantly innovate how you spend
					your time and how the job works.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Not only do jobs promote stagnant time in our day
					once we have one, but to get most jobs a person
					must be perceived as stable.
				</p>
				<p>
					You must often have a house or several that you
					homestead on a regular basis (rent or mortgage
					usually being a requirement of further government
					certification associated with most accepted
					jobs).&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Society shuns those who don&rsquo;t adhere to
					these norms. Or if a person does support companies
					that break these standards - it is from a couch,
					by definition - because there is not yet a network
					filling the gap and providing for them a way to do
					things better.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					If you haven&rsquo;t dug a deep hole into the
					business of paying for government
					&lsquo;licenses&rsquo; and &lsquo;taxes&rsquo;,
					you won&rsquo;t be so devastated when the tides of
					business change and break free from these chains.

						<strong>Healthy Jobs</strong>
					</h3>
				</div>

				<p>
					It is easy to surmise that there are many health
					reasons to avoid repetitive physical or mental
					tasks such as standing still for long periods of
					time with your focus somewhere else. But there are
					many more problems when it comes to the modern-day
					workweek than just these. It&rsquo;s not only that
					we should be able to find work that is seamless
					with whatever life we want to live - we
					don&rsquo;t have to work to live at all if we
					don&rsquo;t want to. Our network makes this
					possible with structures like freedom properties.
				</p>
				<p>
					We must live out our wildest reality - for only
					those actions will create the world we want to
					live in and inspire others through.

					<h3>How to Make Money With Agorism</h3>
				</div>

				<p>
					Whatever job you have, it can translate into the
					agora.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Any profession can be transferred to an agorist
					modality. So rather than changing the names of
					professions, it&rsquo;s about transforming the
					day-to-day realities of those positions.
					It&rsquo;s about being able to make decisions that
					fit our own personal moral framework (so long as
					it follows the ZAP). Thus, our lives and positions
					will mean the things we want them to mean - and
					effect the change we want to affect. We can live
					in a world where everyone is empowered to make
					their own voluntaryist mark upon the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					The potential life paths we are presented with in
					school and by our family and peers are flawed.
					Most of our dreams, in order to become big and
					remain &lsquo;legal&rsquo; in the eyes of the
					government, require expensive licenses, taxes, and
					other advertising barriers that make it hard to
					succeed in the modern world where every minute of
					screen time is bought.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following in the footsteps of the generations
					before us, The new generation is already
					recognizing the lie of secondary education. It is
					very mainstream now to hear stories of people
					succeeding without a college degree or tons of
					money to start off with. But the stories are of
					people who succeeded despite the land mines thrown
					into the path of the everyday person by the very
					government that is supposed to be serving them.
					Why aren&rsquo;t we hearing more about the
					government&rsquo;s direct connection with
					suffering? Because then we might realize it
					doesn&rsquo;t need to exist.

					We are told horror stories of people cast out by
					society and told that the only way to really
					survive is to do it while obeying every law that
					is decided for you by unknown individuals under
					the guise of your fellow Americans.
				</p>
				<p>
					Everyone has their own unique combination of
					skills and interests, and each person's character
					classes will be something that they discover over
					time, and create new names for if they choose;
					which only approximates a description of the whole
					person who is always growing and updating their
					own understanding of themselves.
				</p>
				<p>
					Everyone deserves some time to detox from society
					and decide what they would be doing with their
					lives if they really had the freedom to create a
					life they wanted to live. This involves trying
					their hand at different skills and living in
					different environments. It also includes and
					requires a detox from the nervous system overload
					which is the modern-day measuring stick of success
					in the cities of America.
