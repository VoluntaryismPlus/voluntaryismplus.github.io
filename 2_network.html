				<h1>We Are Network Support</h1>
				<p>
					At the heart of The Agorist Network lies a profound commitment to voluntary mutual aid and decentralized support. We are the architects of a new paradigm, empowering individuals to thrive outside coercive systems by fostering robust connections, sharing knowledge, and providing essential infrastructure for a life lived in authentic freedom.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is not a distant dream or theoretical exercise. This website serves as your practical guide for establishing the foundational infrastructure necessary to bring a voluntary world into vibrant existence, starting today. We are focused on real solutions, right nowâ€”creating tangible options for freedom that you can access and implement in your lifetime.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given that all individuals are inherently equal in rights, what is fundamentally wrong for one is undeniably wrong for all. This bedrock truth, when consistently applied, lays the groundwork for a world where every good, service, association, and interaction is purely voluntary. This vision of collective liberty is achievable in our lifetimes through deliberate action and strategic networking.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>The Problem We're Solving</h2>
				<p>
					How did consumers become so separated from producers? Why are there fewer good options available for food, goods, and other services? Why isn't there a huge supply of untaxed, unregulated grey and black market goods, with countless supply lines providing a robust and healthy market for those who wish to get their needs met through non-government channels?
				</p>
				<p>
					The major reason why more farmers don't work outside of the government system is fear. They have a healthy fear that they will be found and punished if they go against "the law" (aka "the lie"). Our mission is to make it possible for farmers, agorists, and anyone seeking to free themselves from taxes or regulations to sell without fear of government persecution.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a common perception that in order to be "doing agorism", one has to be disconnected from social media and other forms of communication. We recognize the value of privacy and support those who wish to remain disconnected, but there is also great value in having a public-interfacing faction of the network aimed at growing and upgrading the network of individuals who recognize the true nature of the State and who seek to protect the freedom to peacefully conduct oneself with other consenting individuals.
				</p>
				<p>
					There will have to be a group of people who are putting themselves on the line in order to grow the network. We are not trying to make a network that is insular and inaccessible to outsiders. We need to create something that is both safe and widespread, as the survival of the network relies on its dispersed nature, not on one branch becoming large and noticeable and thus susceptible to being torn down.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Our Solution</h2>
				<p>
					Our current system, heavily reliant on taxes and regulations, hinders true freedom and wealth by funding undesirable activities and limiting individual choice. A key problem is the lack of accessible, tax-free goods and services, as producers fear leaving the traditional system due to uncertain demand. While the demand for such "agorist" goods exists, consumers struggle to find them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our solution is a decentralized network that uses Agorism to foster freedom, wealth, and resilience. We're building connections between consumers and producers, creating free marketplaces where all vocations can thrive outside the conventional system. Decentralization ensures there's no single point of failure or monopoly, providing countless sources of goods and services, increased consumer choice, and a robust contingency plan for supply lines.
				</p>
				<p>
					The creation of the network benefits the market and every individual in it—as it is imperative to have multiple sources of goods and services if we are to create resilient, decentralized, and redundant networks.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Beyond "Be the Change"</h2>
				<p>
					We are often told that in order to create the change we want to see in the world, we have to start by changing ourselves. The reasoning goes that if we start having more positive interactions, those around us will also be empowered to have positive interactions. While this idea has merit, it essentially disempowers those who adhere to it. What is implied is that the most change we could possibly feel accountable for is a very small shift in the way certain people think or act due to our positive vibes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most people we meet are already advanced enough spiritually and mentally that they know what it is to be a good person and can recognize a good interaction when they see it. We do not need to become spiritual gurus in order for the world to be affected by our good actions.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the Network, our reasoning is similar but differs in a crucial way. We believe that if you understand the Non-Aggression Principle and its implicationsâ€”including the Self-Defense Principleâ€”once introduced to it, you already have the necessary foundation to empower those around you. The infrastructure needed to make freedom accessible, however, is not yet in place. That's what we're building together.
				</p>
				<p>
					To say that you alone can make the change needed is unrealistic. Perhaps, if you were already surrounded by empowered and flexible voluntaryists who were spending their entire lives creating an agorist counter-economy, simply being armed with information could mobilize you and those around you to participate in a network that would change your lives and eventually the entire world.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, most people exist within webs with others who do not see the same potential outcome of freedom for allâ€”people who, usually out of fear, are not willing to make significant changes to help this reality come into existence. If you are in this situation, we do not encourage you to try to change the minds of those who do not want to hear it. Instead, use this Network to find those who are already on the same path you are. Network with people who already understand that freedom from existing lies, taxes, and restrictions on peaceful activity is needed, and grow resilient trade networks with those individuals toward that shared goal.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Morality and Ethics</h2>
				<p>
					While some dismiss morality as a dangerous and subjective endeavor, not all moral frameworks are equal. The moral philosophy of Voluntaryism stands as a beacon of clarity and simplicity. At its core, Voluntaryism champions the fundamental principle that all human interaction must be entirely consensual and non-coercive. It uniquely focuses its evaluative lens almost exclusively on the initiation of force or fraud, liberating us from arbitrary rules.
				</p>
				<p>
					Voluntaryism doesn't dictate personal choices, lifestyles, or beliefs, no matter how unconventional, as long as they don't infringe upon the equal freedom of others. A true moral principle must be universally applicable and unchanging, a steadfast axiom guiding all interaction. While countless institutions relentlessly seek to obfuscate this truth, seducing us into accepting that some humans possess rights they don't, we recognize this illusion for what it is. The current state of human emergency, fueled by compulsory taxes and regulations, demands a pioneering solutionâ€”a life forged from genuine consent, not coercion.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>The Illusion of Delegated Rights</h2>
				<p>
					Most are convinced that the rules governing our current society are immutable, even believing that unjust laws must be blindly obeyed and enforced. This way of thinking is rooted in a palpable fear of repercussion, a fear intensified by the absence of a widely known and proven pathway toward a life unfettered by coercive dictates. While this fear is understandable, it's a barrier we're actively dismantling.
				</p>
				<p>
					You inherently own yourself, possessing the undeniable right to choose with whom you'll associate, to whom you'll pay tribute, or to what you'll be subjected. This simple truth forms the bedrock of our moral code. You can't delegate rights you don't possess; no individual or group can ever legitimately decide what another person consents to. Yet, in this society, many tragically pretend to delegate these non-existent "rights" to individuals known as "elected officials," enforced by "police," and upheld by a monopolized injustice system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Acknowledging these stark facts can evoke complex emotions, but crucially, it doesn't mean we're powerless to change this world for the better. We choose to rally around a common causeâ€”Freedomâ€”rather than against a common enemy. To us, freedom isn't merely about escaping monstrous systems; it's profoundly measured by your unhindered ability to conduct your consensual, voluntary affairs as you see fit, without fear of illegitimate repercussions. Our lifestyle, at an individual level, liberates us from many unnecessary taxes and regulations, and our unwavering goal is to pioneer, provision access to, and foster a parallel networkâ€”a truly free way of life and counter-economy of morally-conscious individuals.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Current Limiting Structural Beliefs</h2>
				<p>
					There's a prevailing, yet deceptive, perception that opportunities are scarce for those who desire autonomy and freedom. While it's true that numerous obstacles currently impede individuals from living authentically, this narrow view misses the explosive potential we collectively possess. The existing literature often overlooks the immense power inherent in a group of millions, or even hundreds of thousands, of individuals who understand what needs to be done. We possess the collective strength to effortlessly liberate the rest of the world from governmental enslavement.
				</p>
				<p>
					We clearly see the boundless possibility residing within each person who understands The Network. When certain strategic constraints are embraced, they don't limit but rather amplify our collective impact, yielding profoundly potent results. Those who actively participate within these vital constraints are considered part of our "engine," driving the collective forward. For those outside this core "engine," vastly more connects usâ€”our shared human sovereigntyâ€”than divides us.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>The Current Lies</h2>
				<p>
					Any institution that initiates or threatens force against the person or property of others has no legitimate right to exist. By this undeniable principle, the authority-based power structures that call themselves "The State" are fundamentally illegitimate and entirely unnecessary for any positive paradigm shifts from this moment forward. They shouldn't, and needn't, exist.
				</p>
				<p>
					These oppressive institutions have never gained power through consent; their rise is solely attributable to murder, lies, and deception. Their singular, brutal strategy for "solving" problems is the use, or credible threat, of violence. There's no coherent argument for authority that withstands scrutiny, precisely because we are all equal in rightsâ€”none possess extra rights to do what is wrong for others. For any principle to be genuinely moral, it must be universally applicable: it is always wrong to initiate or threaten force against the person or property of other peaceful individuals.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>What is Lacking in the Current Ideology?</h2>
				<p>
					Countless people globally are committed to higher levels of freedom for themselves and are passionate about the freedom of others. The infrastructure necessary to sustain ever-increasing freedom already exists today. What has been conspicuously absent from most proposed solutions is a simple, wide-scale, and universally applicable strategy. The Network is here to provide the direct coordination needed to completely defund the systems to which we don't consent, offering a clear, ideologically simple idea of freedom for all people, without adherence to any single, rigid system.
				</p>
				<p>
					We bridge the gap from merely surviving to genuinely thriving. While it's true that polycentric outcomes in a free society are inherently unknown, this doesn't negate the fact that specific, pivotal events will inevitably lead toward the adoption of this new world. There are already enough committed voluntaryists that if they were to act cohesively, the powerful example they set would become undeniably visible to the larger public. It is then the very free nature of Voluntaryism itself that will empower countless more to recognize the efficacy and abundance of this way of living.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>What Can We Do About the Current "State" of Affairs?</h2>
				<p>
					We must forge a vivid, feasible vision for transitioning from our current reality to a truly free one. The absence of such a clear vision is a primary reason why many become inactive or disillusioned within their existing communities. People fall victim to the crippling mentality that genuine freedom isn't "realistic" or "practical," or that certain outcomes are virtually impossible in our lifetimes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The only time change truly becomes impossible is when enough people continue to believe it is so and choose to do nothing. Our high-level plan is elegantly simple: those who already embrace Voluntaryism are all we need. They must redirect all their resourcesâ€”their labor, their thought, their very essenceâ€”towards the free world, cultivating a purely agorist marketplace and establishing protected living spaces where all interactions exist free of state coercion. As this marketplace flourishes, individuals from cities will naturally gravitate towards our markets and events, discovering the real-world applications of Voluntaryism and learning how to access their local network of protected free markets. Slowly, inevitably, the state will lose its suffocating grasp on our hearts, minds, and resources, enabling a full transition into the True Realm.
				</p>
			</div>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Building the Alternative Reality</h2>
				<p>
					We don't need to escape this world. We have everything we need here to create the next phase of existence. This is the world that, in time, becomes the ideal world for each individual. How can each person have their own ideal coexisting with every other person's ideal, simultaneously? The answer is voluntary pluralism.
				</p>
				<p>
					To get a more concise and potent result, we're more concise with our parameters. We're not judging those who don't follow these parameters, but we're making a distinction within our own decisions to do business with others who are actively creating more freedom for others instead of creating only a space for themselves to temporarily reduce their own oppression while doing little to manifest or support protected free markets.
				</p>
				<p>
					We believe in real solutions, right now! We don't want to spend our lives working for other people's goals while doing nothing or very little toward what we're in this realm to achieve, which has nothing to do with slaving away for money.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>People don't see an option.</li>
						<li>We're creating an option.</li>
						<li>You can create an option.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
					Understanding what is possible will lead to a more extensive awareness and empowered utilization of these communities, both with each other and by those still more entrenched in the slave society.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Making Government Optional</h2>
				<p>
					Government should be optional, not required. We are <em>free</em> people, aren't we? We aren't trying to abolish the State. If there are people who still wish to use a State for provision of specific goods or services, they should still be free to contract in such ways, but again, they in the <em>new</em> realm will enter into such contracts voluntarily and with the free-will choice to say no without punishment or retaliation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The idea is to help everyone who's having trouble redirecting their income stream and expenditures to purely agorist sourcesâ€"so we can keep the wealth in the family and grow a system that will stand resolute against all threats.
				</p>
				<p>
					We know this will work, and we want to help form and strengthen the bonds that will replace weak supply lines currently "providing" for us. The necessity of the State is the story we tell ourselves. We can get everyone we know to stop telling that story. We're building a network of capable people who can protect each other and the world. We're on voluntary teams that work outside of the government.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have a business model that can't fail. The value people are already generating can be redirected towards the agorist network and thus go much further towards true growth and prosperity. This enables a lifestyle maximized for freedom.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h1>Igniting the Engine</h1>
				<p>
					Our model requires no capital to run; it's a dynamic framework designed to empower others to strategically utilize their time and resources toward safeguarding freedom. We don't need donations; we need dedicated individuals on the ground, clearly articulating what's already possible and actively creating the next level of opportunities. This Network is poised to guide those seeking protected free markets, facilitating a seamless transition from mere survival to genuine thriving.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eventually, The Network will become a haven for everyone, offering a clear path away from every unsatisfactory aspect of their current lives. Whether you aspire to learn a trade within a Guild, launch your own profession, or simply live freely on land arbitrated by no ruler, choosing freedom is the most obvious and beneficial path. Life becomes easier and more profitable, with more time in your day when the fruits of your productive energy are no longer siphoned away into the wasteful, unethical games of politicians and well-meaning voters. Similarly, the incentive to work skyrockets when you know your labor consistently contributes to your enduring support. We are The Network Support, and we are igniting the engine of change.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>The Perpetual Engine</h2>
				<p>
					We aren't creating the network itself; The Network already exists, though currently dispersed and small. Its full potential will only manifest when it's given the precise push and intention it deserves. Instead, envision us as Network Support, dedicating our entire lives and livelihoods to forging stronger bonds among existing network participants. We foster a larger vision for how we can holistically address the needs of our decentralized, freedom-supporting communities and markets in every conceivable way.
				</p>
				<p>
					A peaceful society is achievable, founded on a truly simple concept: no individual should aggress upon another or their property. All agreements and associations between individuals or groups must be purely voluntary and consensual. No person or group should ever be granted the 'freedom' to aggress. Justice is rooted in restitution, ensuring victims can exact compensation from their aggressors. Furthermore, individuals targeted by aggression must never be prevented from exercising defensive force in opposition. We identify these as the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP), the Self-Defense Principle (SDP), and the Principle of Restitution (PoR). We can pave the way for an organic, voluntary society based solely on these precepts, but this demands more than merely encouraging the spread of voluntaryist culture in immediate surroundings. Even small voluntaryist communities can't create a truly free society in the larger world unless they share a broader vision for freedom beyond their own domain and actively join to create the indispensable network of protected free markets.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Our Role</h2>
				<p>
					We aren't the network itself, nor does its materialization depend on any single individual. However, our Caravan fulfills a critically important role within this larger ecosystem. While a majority of the people we encounter aspire to settle on property and cultivate their own foodâ€”an endeavor of undeniable soundnessâ€”one of their biggest struggles is finding a consistent market for their goods and services, both within and beyond their homestead.
				</p>
				<p>
					Farming and producing goods are profoundly desirable endeavors, offering a direct connection to one's efforts to exist in a healthy and positive way, unlike earning money from unrelated tasks. The challenge lies in reaching new customers when farms are often distant from major cities, and the substantial costs of transportation can drastically reduce profits and consume valuable time. As full-time nomads, our operational model inherently subsidizes these travel costs through the sheer volume of goods we transport. For example, we strategically incorporate rideshare and package delivery to optimize our travels, ensuring every movement generates value.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p>
					Do you believe in a society where all interactions are voluntary and consensual? This website illuminates a tangible path for every person towards a life more aligned with their true potential and desires. It also serves as a crucial introduction to a Network that already exists in its formative stages, aiming to soon provide clean, freedom-oriented alternatives for every need an individual may have.
				</p>
				<p>
					This guide is here to clarify your next move. It's rich with actionable plans and vital resources for collaboration, offering strategies in every section to meet most needs. Our bounty board and social boards actively connect individuals with available resources, fostering a dynamic exchange. Without the parasitic drain and coercive constraints of the state, everyone can truly live a free and fulfilling life they can be proud of. This demands discipline, clear intention, and a willingness to adapt one's lifestyle towards manifesting a more free world for themselves and others, coupled with our continuous vigilance in safeguarding our markets from aggressors. We are cultivating a world of decentralized, interconnected voluntary relationships between equals, because that is the only truly just future. There is no free world in which force or coercion can persist unchecked, much less become institutionalized. Because of the concise nature of our plan, the outcome will be an abundance that seems impossible in these bleak times. Those who participate will revel in bounty once stolen by the State, enjoying a higher standard of living not only materially, but also in social wealth and resilience gained through intentional networking. Participation can manifest on many levels, both overtly and covertly, and part of our work is to make leaving the old, destructive ways smart, easy, fun, and cool.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Practical Benefits of Network Participation</h2>
				<p>
					When you begin to think in terms of the real world and what is possible when people are free to act as they want, you can begin to see the value that would be kept in the family if we made more decisions that favored people who knew how to direct their actions toward building a strong network that will take care of us when we're in trouble.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, the network we are working on opposes the idea of keeping a job that funds the state when there are jobs available to you that don't. That's why we are working to expand the number of jobs available within the network that meet these criteria: they do not fund the state or people who fund the state. Eventually, this will look like all participants in all transactions not funding the state with their shelter, job, food, or leisure activities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The creation of the network benefits the market and every individual in itâ€”as it is imperative to have multiple sources of goods and services if we are to create resilient, decentralized, and redundant networks. The larger community is made up of individuals who have the skills and knowledge necessary to support one another. What support does the individual need from a network? Every good or service you spend money on can be re-sourced. Medical care, insurance, gasoline, jobs, and education to name a few. Everything that drives the world today can be provided in a better way by the community.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Bring Everyone Along</h2>
				<p>
					We want the option of freedom for all. Coercion is something that affects all aspects of our lives. We can run away into the woods and wait for the laws and society to come out and reach us there, or we can take actions to make sure the larger social structure in which we exist becomes less coercive to us over time. If your plan doesn't bring more freedom to the greater world you live within as well as to your private world, you're not on the wrong path; but we want to help expand your personal vision so that you can coexist in a network with other like-minded individuals. We're adding resources and connecting people to resources that aren't easily attainable in this current world. We believe it's easy to add a truly altruistic component to freedom when an option is offered that's competitive and readily available. For too long we've been oppressed by a government that doesn't serve us.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of us have questions such as: Why can't my loved ones find a community that provides for them instead of depleting them? Why can't we find affordable local food that doesn't fund the state? We have the answers for these questions. The State itself is unnecessary, and without it, we'd be able to live as makes sense.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many have the option to move out of the toxic cities, get food from local sources, and protect themselves far beyond the usual defenses such as pepper spray and a cell phone. However, some can't leave the statist parts of their lives as easily based on personal or family health conditions, child custody issues, or other obligations. This won't always be the case, however. There will be agorist solutions to all of these issues. The more resilient and fail-proof our networks are, the harder it will be for those in control to restrict our actions. There will be more and more options available and nobody can predict how amazing it will turn out.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Multiple Ways to Engage</h2>
				<p>
					Networking with other freedom-seekers and expanding your social circles and trade options is the most effective way of creating the best of all possible worlds. We know this is the way to create the best of all possible worlds because it permits everyone to choose how to spend their time and resources without third parties imposing themselves on their free-will choices.
				</p>
				<p>
					This entire endeavor is focused on real solutions and pulling anarchists out of the current paradigm and placing them in the situations they need, regardless of the resources or money they have amassed as of yet in the zombie system. It's not too hard to opt-out if you have enough support. This network is providing the extra support needed by those who don't already have a group of individuals bolstering their efforts to bring about a free and thriving existence for themselves and others.
				</p>
				<p>
					For those who want to get involved but don't know how that would look, there are many pathways available:

				<h2>Supporting the Network</h2>
				<p>
					We retain a unique perspective based on our exposure to a diverse demographic of communities. We are historians and philosophers with a large sphere of influence. While we don't need donations nearly as much as we need people on the ground taking action, contributions do help us expand our infrastructure and reach.
				</p>
				<p>
					Donations go towards a network that will provide for everyone in the ways we want and need from our community. They fund:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Mobile infrastructure for caravans (vehicles, equipment, tools)</li>
					<li>Free event spaces and temporary marketplaces</li>
					<li>Educational materials and outreach</li>
					<li>Emergency support for network members in need</li>
