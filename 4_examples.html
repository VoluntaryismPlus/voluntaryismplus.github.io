				<h2>Jericho</h2>
				<h5>11,000 B.C.E. - 9,000 B.C.E.</h5>
				<p>
					The early settlement of Jericho, one of the oldest
					continuously inhabited cities in the world,
					provides a fascinating glimpse into pre-state
					social organization. During its early Neolithic
					phases, particularly the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A
					and B periods, archaeological evidence suggests a
					society that lacked the hallmarks of a
					centralized, coercive state. While walls were
					built, likely for defense against external threats
					or to manage resources, there is little indication
					of a hierarchical political structure, a ruling
					elite, or a standing army enforcing laws.
				</p>
				<p>
					Decisions regarding community projects, resource
					allocation, and conflict resolution appear to have
					been made communally or through informal,
					decentralized mechanisms, demonstrating a capacity
					for complex social organization without the need
					for a dominating state apparatus.
				</p>

				<h3>Dates</h3>
				<p>
					11,000 B.C.E. - 9,000 B.C.E. This period
					represents Jericho's early, pre-state phases where
					social organization thrived without centralized
					authority.
				</p>

				<h2>Çatalhöyük</h2>
				<h5>7500 B.C. - 6400 B.C.</h5>
				<p>
					The Neolithic settlement of Çatalhöyük in Anatolia
					is renowned for its unique urban layout and social
					structure, which challenges conventional
					understandings of early civilization. For over a
					millennium, its inhabitants lived in closely
					packed, interconnected dwellings with no
					discernible streets or public buildings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Crucially, archaeological excavations have
					revealed a striking lack of evidence for social
					stratification, such as differences in housing
					size, burial goods, or monumental architecture
					dedicated to a ruler or deity. There are no signs
					of a central authority, a ruling class, or
					specialized institutions for governance or law
					enforcement. Instead, decisions and social order
					appear to have been maintained through horizontal
					relationships, shared cultural norms, and
					localized family or clan structures, highlighting
					a complex and thriving society that operated
					without the presence of a coercive state.
				</p>
				<div class="image">

				</div>
				<h3>Dates</h3>
				<p>
					7500 B.C.E. - 6400 B.C.E. These dates mark the
					primary Neolithic occupation of the eastern mound,
					during which Çatalhöyük exhibited its notable
					stateless characteristics.

				<h2>Xeer Legal system</h2>
				<h5>Somalia</h5>
				<h5>600 C.E. - 1600 C.E.</h5>
				<p>
					For centuries, much of Somali society has operated
					under the Xeer legal system, a customary law
					tradition that exemplifies a decentralized,
					stateless form of governance. Rather than relying
					on a central government or judiciary, Xeer is a
					complex body of unwritten laws, agreements, and
					social contracts negotiated and enforced by
					elders, clan councils, and ad hoc assemblies.
					Disputes are resolved through mediation,
					compensation, and negotiation, with strong social
					pressures and clan honor acting as primary
					enforcement mechanisms.
				</p>
				<p>
					This system operates without prisons, police
					forces, or a formalized state bureaucracy,
					demonstrating how a society can maintain order,
					resolve conflicts, and regulate social
					interactions through voluntary agreements and
					community-based enforcement, underscoring a
					profound absence of a centralized, coercive state.
				</p>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="img/Somalia.png" />
				</div>
				<h3>Dates</h3>
				<p>
					600 C.E. - 1600 C.E. This range represents a
					significant historical period of Xeer's prominent
					use, though its influence and active application
					continue in many parts of Somalia today.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Brehon Law</h2>
				<h5>600 C.E. - 1600 C.E.</h5>
				<p>
					Brehon Law, the indigenous legal system of Ireland
					before the Norman invasion, provides a compelling
					historical example of a highly sophisticated legal
					framework operating without a centralized state.
					Rather than a king or government dictating laws,
					Brehon Law was administered by brehons (jurists)
					who were highly respected legal experts. These
					brehons did not make law but interpreted and
					applied a vast body of customary laws, precedents,
					and legal principles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Enforcement was largely decentralized, relying on
					social pressure, reputation, and the payment of
					fines or restitution. There was no standing army
					or police force to compel compliance; instead, a
					person's honor and the collective pressure of
					their kin group ensured adherence. This system
					fostered a society where justice was delivered
					through a highly developed legal scholarship and
					community accountability, rather than through the
					coercive power of a state.
				</p>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="img/Ireland.png" />
				</div>
				<h3>Dates</h3>
				<p>
					600 C.E. - 1600 C.E. This period encompasses the
					full development and widespread application of
					Brehon Law as a formalized system before its
					suppression by external powers.
				</p>

				<h2>Icelandic Commonwealth</h2>
				<h5>930 C.E. - 1262 C.E.</h5>
				<p>
					The Icelandic Commonwealth stands as a remarkable
					historical example of a society that functioned
					for over four centuries without a centralized
					executive authority or a standing army.
					Conventionally dated from its formal beginning in
					930 C.E. with the establishment of the Althing –
					though its settlement began earlier around 874
					C.E. – the Commonwealth thrived on decentralized
					principles. Power was distributed among chieftains
					(goðar) who held both religious and legal
					influence, but their authority was derived solely
					from the voluntary allegiance of their followers,
					not from a coercive state apparatus. The Althing,
					a national assembly, served as a legislative and
					judicial body where laws were debated and disputes
					resolved, yet it lacked any executive power to
					enforce its rulings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Enforcement relied primarily on private legal
					action, arbitration, and the social pressure of
					the community. Its unique existence came to an end
					around 1262-1264 C.E. with the "Old Covenant"
					(Gamli sáttmáli), when Icelanders pledged
					allegiance to the Norwegian king, followed by the
					adoption of the Jónsbók law code in 1281 C.E. This
					period in Icelandic history is often cited as a
					prime example of a functioning anarchist society,
					demonstrating how complex social order could be
					maintained through decentralized governance,
					voluntary association, and an elaborate legal
					system without the presence of a coercive state.
				</p>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="img/Iceland.png" />
				</div>
				<h3>Dates</h3>
				<p>
					930 C.E. - 1262 C.E. This precise range covers the
					formal establishment of the Althing and the
					duration of the Commonwealth as a distinct,
					stateless political entity before its subjugation.

				<h2>Neutral Moresnet</h2>
				<h5>1816 C.E. - 1919 C.E.</h5>
				<p>
					Neutral Moresnet, a tiny condominium administered
					jointly by the Netherlands (and later Belgium) and
					Prussia (and later Germany), existed for over a
					century with a remarkably decentralized and
					largely self-governing character. Formed due to a
					border dispute, neither larger power fully
					asserted its control, leading to a unique
					situation where the local population largely
					managed its own affairs. While there were nominal
					administrators from the co-ruling powers, the
					community developed a strong sense of autonomy,
					with little direct interference or coercive state
					presence. Local committees, communal
					decision-making, and a pragmatic approach to
					governance meant that for decades, this small
					territory operated with minimal centralized
					authority, showcasing how a community can thrive
					and maintain order with a significant absence of a
					formal, powerful state apparatus, particularly
					notable for the rise of Esperanto as a potential
					official language in the early 20th century,
					further highlighting its unique, non-state
					character.
				</p>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="img/Moresnet.png" />
				</div>
				<h3>Dates</h3>
				<p>
					1816 C.E. - 1919 C.E. This period marks the
					establishment of Neutral Moresnet's unique status
					until its formal dissolution by the Treaty of
					Versailles.
