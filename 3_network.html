				We Are Network Support
			</h1>
			<div class="innersection">
				<p>At the heart of the Agorist Network lies a profound commitment to voluntary mutual aid and decentralized support. We are the architects of a new paradigm, empowering individuals to thrive outside coercive systems by fostering robust connections, sharing knowledge, and providing essential infrastructure for a life lived in authentic freedom.</p><p>
					Given that all individuals are inherently equal in
					rights, what is fundamentally wrong for one is
					undeniably wrong for all. This bedrock truth, when
					consistently applied, lays the groundwork for a
					world where every good, service, association, and
					interaction is purely voluntary. This vision of
					collective liberty is not a distant dream; this
					website serves as your essential guide for
					establishing the foundational infrastructure
					necessary to bring this voluntary world into
					vibrant existence, starting today.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Morality and Ethics</h2>
				<p>
					While some dismiss morality as a dangerous and
					subjective endeavor, not all moral frameworks are
					equal. The moral philosophy of Voluntaryism stands
					as a beacon of clarity and simplicity. At its
					core, Voluntaryism champions the fundamental
					principle that all human interaction must be
					entirely consensual and non-coercive. It uniquely
					focuses its evaluative lens almost exclusively on
					the initiation of force or fraud, liberating us
					from arbitrary rules.
				</p>
				<p>
					Voluntaryism does not dictate personal choices,
					lifestyles, or beliefs, no matter how
					unconventional, as long as they do not infringe
					upon the equal freedom of others. A true moral
					principle must be universally applicable and
					unchanging, a steadfast axiom guiding all
					interaction. While countless institutions
					relentlessly seek to obfuscate this truth,
					seducing us into accepting that some humans
					possess rights they do not, we recognize this
					illusion for what it is. The current state of
					human emergency, fueled by compulsory taxes and
					regulations, demands a pioneering solution—a life
					forged from genuine consent, not coercion.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>The Illusion of Delegated Rights</h2>
				<p>
					Most are convinced that the rules governing our
					current society are immutable, even believing that
					unjust laws must be blindly obeyed and enforced.
					This way of thinking is rooted in a palpable fear
					of repercussion, a fear intensified by the absence
					of a widely known and proven pathway toward a life
					unfettered by coercive dictates. While this fear
					is understandable, it is a barrier we are actively
					dismantling.
				</p>
				<p>
					You inherently own yourself, possessing the
					undeniable right to choose with whom you will
					associate, to whom you will pay tribute, or to
					what you will be subjected. This simple truth
					forms the bedrock of our moral code. You cannot
					delegate rights you do not possess; no individual
					or group can ever legitimately decide what another
					person consents to. Yet, in this society, many
					tragically pretend to delegate these non-existent
					"rights" to individuals known as "elected
					officials," enforced by "police," and upheld by a
					monopolized injustice system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Acknowledging these stark facts can evoke complex
					emotions, but crucially, it does not mean we are
					powerless to change this world for the better. We
					choose to rally around a common
					cause—Freedom—rather than against a common enemy.
					To us, freedom is not merely about escaping
					monstrous systems; it is profoundly measured by
					your unhindered ability to conduct your
					consensual, voluntary affairs as you see fit,
					without fear of illegitimate repercussions. Our
					lifestyle, at an individual level, liberates us
					from many unnecessary taxes and regulations, and
					our unwavering goal is to pioneer, provision
					access to, and foster a parallel network—a truly
					free way of life and counter-economy of
					morally-conscious individuals.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Current Limiting Structural Beliefs</h2>
				<p>
					There's a prevailing, yet deceptive, perception
					that opportunities are scarce for those who desire
					autonomy and freedom. While it's true that
					numerous obstacles currently impede individuals
					from living authentically, this narrow view misses
					the explosive potential we collectively possess.
					The existing literature often overlooks the
					immense power inherent in a group of millions, or
					even hundreds of thousands, of individuals who
					understand what needs to be done. We possess the
					collective strength to effortlessly liberate the
					rest of the world from governmental enslavement.
				</p>
				<p>
					We clearly see the boundless possibility residing
					within each person who understands the Network.
					When certain strategic constraints are embraced,
					they don't limit but rather amplify our collective
					impact, yielding profoundly potent results. Those
					who actively participate within these vital
					constraints are considered part of our "engine,"
					driving the collective forward. For those outside
					this core "engine," vastly more connects us—our
					shared human sovereignty—than divides us.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>The Current Lies</h2>
				<p>
					Any institution that initiates or threatens force
					against the person or property of others has no
					legitimate right to exist. By this undeniable
					principle, the authority-based power structures
					that call themselves "The State" are fundamentally
					illegitimate and entirely unnecessary for any
					positive paradigm shifts from this moment forward.
					They should not, and need not, exist.
				</p>
				<p>
					These oppressive institutions have never gained
					power through consent; their rise is solely
					attributable to murder, lies, and deception. Their
					singular, brutal strategy for "solving" problems
					is the use, or credible threat, of violence. There
					is no coherent argument for authority that
					withstands scrutiny, precisely because we are all
					equal in rights—none possess extra rights to do
					what is wrong for others. For any principle to be
					genuinely moral, it must be universally
					applicable: it is always wrong to initiate or
					threaten force against the person or property of
					other peaceful individuals.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>What is Lacking in the Current Ideology?</h2>
				<p>
					Countless people globally are committed to higher
					levels of freedom for themselves and are
					passionate about the freedom of others. The
					infrastructure necessary to sustain
					ever-increasing freedom already exists today. What
					has been conspicuously absent from most proposed
					solutions is a simple, wide-scale, and universally
					applicable strategy. The Network is here to
					provide the direct coordination needed to
					completely defund the systems to which we do not
					consent, offering a clear, ideologically simple
					idea of freedom for all people, without adherence
					to any single, rigid system.
				</p>
				<p>
					We bridge the gap from merely surviving to
					genuinely thriving. While it is true that
					polycentric outcomes in a free society are
					inherently unknown, this does not negate the fact
					that specific, pivotal events will inevitably lead
					toward the adoption of this new world. There are
					already enough committed voluntaryists that if
					they were to act cohesively, the powerful example
					they set would become undeniably visible to the
					larger public. It is then the very free nature of
					Voluntaryism itself that will empower countless
					more to recognize the efficacy and abundance of
					this way of living.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>
					What Can We Do About the Current "State" of
					Affairs?
				</h2>
				<p>
					We must forge a vivid, feasible vision for
					transitioning from our current reality to a truly
					free one. The absence of such a clear vision is a
					primary reason why many become inactive or
					disillusioned within their existing communities.
					People fall victim to the crippling mentality that
					genuine freedom isn't "realistic" or "practical,"
					or that certain outcomes are virtually impossible
					in our lifetimes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The only time change truly becomes impossible is
					when enough people continue to believe it is so
					and choose to do nothing. Our high-level plan is
					elegantly simple: those who already embrace
					Voluntaryism are all we need. They must redirect
					all their resources—their labor, their thought,
					their very essence—towards the free world,
					cultivating a purely agorist marketplace and
					establishing protected living spaces where all
					interactions exist free of state coercion. As this
					marketplace flourishes, individuals from cities
					will naturally gravitate towards our markets and
					events, discovering the real-world applications of
					Voluntaryism and learning how to access their
					local network of protected free markets. Slowly,
					inevitably, the state will lose its suffocating
					grasp on our hearts, minds, and resources,
					enabling a full transition into the True Realm.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Igniting the Engine</h2>
				<p>
					Our model requires no capital to run; it is a
					dynamic framework designed to empower others to
					strategically utilize their time and resources
					toward safeguarding freedom. We don't need
					donations; we need dedicated individuals on the
					ground, clearly articulating what is already
					possible and actively creating the next level of
					opportunities. This Network is poised to guide
					those seeking protected free markets, facilitating
					a seamless transition from mere survival to
					genuine thriving.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eventually, the Network will become a haven for
					everyone, offering a clear path away from every
					unsatisfactory aspect of their current lives.
					Whether you aspire to learn a trade within a
					Guild, launch your own profession, or simply live
					freely on land arbitrated by no ruler, choosing
					freedom is the most obvious and beneficial path.
					Life becomes easier and more profitable, with more
					time in your day when the fruits of your
					productive energy are no longer siphoned away into
					the wasteful, unethical games of politicians and
					well-meaning voters. Similarly, the incentive to
					work skyrockets when you know your labor
					consistently contributes to your enduring support.
					We are the Network Support, and we are igniting
					the engine of change.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>The Perpetual Engine</h2>
				<p>
					We are not creating the network itself; the
					Network already exists, though currently dispersed
					and small. Its full potential will only manifest
					when it is given the precise push and intention it
					deserves. Instead, envision us as Network Support,
					dedicating our entire lives and livelihoods to
					forging stronger bonds among existing network
					participants. We foster a larger vision for how we
					can holistically address the needs of our
					decentralized, freedom-supporting communities and
					markets in every conceivable way.
				</p>
				<p>
					A peaceful society is achievable, founded on a
					truly simple concept: no individual should aggress
					upon another or their property. All agreements and
					associations between individuals or groups must be
					purely voluntary and consensual. No person or
					group should ever be granted the 'freedom' to
					aggress. Justice is rooted in restitution,
					ensuring victims can exact compensation from their
					aggressors. Furthermore, individuals targeted by
					aggression must never be prevented from exercising
					defensive force in opposition. We identify these
					as the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP), the
					Self-Defense Principle (SDP), and the Principle of
					Restitution (PoR). We can pave the way for an
					organic, voluntary society based solely on these
					precepts, but this demands more than merely
					encouraging the spread of voluntaryist culture in
					immediate surroundings. Even small voluntaryist
					communities cannot create a truly free society in
					the larger world unless they share a broader
					vision for freedom beyond their own domain and
					actively join to create the indispensable network
					of protected free markets.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<h2>Our Role</h2>
				<p>
					We are not the network itself, nor does its
					materialization depend on any single individual.
					However, our Caravan fulfills a critically
					important role within this larger ecosystem. While
					a majority of the people we encounter aspire to
					settle on property and cultivate their own food—an
					endeavor of undeniable soundness—one of their
					biggest struggles is finding a consistent market
					for their goods and services, both within and
					beyond their homestead.
				</p>
				<p>
					Farming and producing goods are profoundly
					desirable endeavors, offering a direct connection
					to one's efforts to exist in a healthy and
					positive way, unlike earning money from unrelated
					tasks. The challenge lies in reaching new
					customers when farms are often distant from major
					cities, and the substantial costs of
					transportation can drastically reduce profits and
					consume valuable time. As full-time nomads, our
					operational model inherently subsidizes these
					travel costs through the sheer volume of goods we
					transport. For example, we strategically
					incorporate rideshare and package delivery to
					optimize our travels, ensuring every movement
					generates value.

					This website illuminates a tangible path for every
					person towards a life more aligned with their true
					potential and desires. It also serves as a crucial
					introduction to a Network that already exists in
					its formative stages, aiming to soon provide
					clean, freedom-oriented alternatives for every
					need an individual may have.
				</p>
				<p>
					This guide is here to clarify your next move. It
					is rich with actionable plans and vital resources
					for collaboration, offering strategies in every
					section to meet most needs. Our bounty board and
					social boards actively connect individuals with
					available resources, fostering a dynamic exchange.
					Without the parasitic drain and coercive
					constraints of the state, everyone can truly live
					a free and fulfilling life they can be proud of.
					This demands discipline, clear intention, and a
					willingness to adapt one's lifestyle towards
					manifesting a more free world for themselves and
					others, coupled with our continuous vigilance in
					safeguarding our markets from aggressors. We are
					cultivating a world of decentralized,
					interconnected voluntary relationships between
					equals, because that is the only truly just
					future. There is no free world in which force or
					coercion can persist unchecked, much less become
					institutionalized. Because of the concise nature
					of our plan, the outcome will be an abundance that
					seems impossible in these bleak times. Those who
					participate will revel in bounty once stolen by
					the State, enjoying a higher standard of living
					not only materially, but also in social wealth and
					resilience gained through intentional networking.
					Participation can manifest on many levels, both
					overtly and covertly, and part of our work is to
					make leaving the old, destructive ways smart,
					easy, fun, and cool.

						<em>Bring Everyone Along&nbsp;</em>
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					We want the option of freedom for all. Coersion is
					something that affects all aspects of our lives.
					We can run away into the woods and wait for the
					laws and society to come out and reach us there,
					or we can take actions to make sure the larger
					social structure in which we exist becomes less
					coersive to us over time. If your plan
					doesn&rsquo;t bring more freedom to the greater
					world you live within as well as to your private
					world, you are not on the wrong path; but we want
					to help expand your personal vision so that you
					can coexist in a network with other like-minded
					individuals. We are adding resources and
					connecting people to resources that aren&rsquo;t
					easily attainable in this current world. We
					believe it is easy to add a truly altruistic
					component to freedom when an option is offered
					that is competitive and readily available. For too
					long we have been oppressed by a government that
					does not serve us.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of us have questions such as: Why can&rsquo;t
					my loved ones find a community that provides for
					them instead of depleting them? Why can&rsquo;t we
					find affordable local food that doesn&rsquo;t fund
					the state? We have the answers for these
					questions. The State itself is unnecessary, and
					without it, we would be able to live as makes
					sense.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Many have the option to move out of the toxic
					cities, get food from local sources, and protect
					themselves far beyond the usual defenses such as
					pepper spray and a cell phone. However, some
					can&rsquo;t leave the statist parts of their lives
					as easily based on personal or family health
					conditions, child custody issues, or other
					obligations. This will not always be the case,
					however. There will be agorist solutions to all of
					these issues. The more resilient and fail-proof
					our networks are, the harder it will be for those
					in control to restrict our actions. There will be
					more and more options available and nobody can
					predict how amazing it will turn out.
