					<em
						>The only way to deal with an unfree world is to
						become so absolutely free that your very
						existence is an act of rebellion.</em
					>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Albert Camus</li>
				</ul>
				<p>"Agorist Degrees" is a unique self-assessment tool designed to help you map out your personal journey of un-plugging from coercive systems and actively contributing to the creation of robust, voluntary alternatives.</p>
				<p>
					The best way to take down the state is to live
					your life as an act of rebellion. Agorism has been
					around as long as humanity has. This is a guide to
					look at your life choices through that lens.
				</p>
				<p>
					Agorism is a free-market anarchist philosophy that
					advocates achieving freedom through nonviolent and
					peaceful black market and grey market economics.
					This philosophy has been around for as long as
					humanity has existed. Agorist degrees help you
					look at your life choices through the lens of
					agorism. They are a self-assessment tool designed
					to help those in the network map out the options
					they have when it comes to unplugging themselves
					from the coercive system, or being part of the
					movement to create alternatives to the coercive
					Statist paradigm. Think of it as an anarchist
					version of a New Year&rsquo;s resolution list.
				</p>
				<p>
					This does not prescribe any specific action. We
					have suggestions here and more information in
					other publications on how you can achieve your
					goals without changing every single aspect of your
					life.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					The main question we are focused on is: Are you
					living your life in a way that, should others
					follow your example, would eventually lead to the
					abolishment of the slavery that is government?
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3><strong>A Path Forward</strong></h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					<em
						>We only need a certain amount of people to
						change their actions to defund the state and to
						create, fund, and help grow agorist
						alternatives</em
					>. You can create spaces of freedom in the world
					today!
				</p>
				<p>
					We are encouraging people to assess themselves on
					several areas of their life. They can use these
					pages, if they choose, to do a self assessment on
					several areas of their choice. This can be used to
					create a &lsquo;star plot&rsquo; or graph
					resembling a web on which they are or ought to be
					spending their energy.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					If our energy is being put towards endeavors that
					do not create lasting results in our lives, we
					need to explore options that better suit our needs
					and desires. Most people don&rsquo;t have the
					means currently to live the exact calling they
					feel they are here to do, or even utilize what
					they imagine would be the most effective use of
					their time and energy. However, agorism provides a
					much greater chance of success with these desires.
				</p>
				<p>
					This guide is a way for those who participate in
					the assessment to notate what they have achieved
					so far and to brainstorm actionable ways to
					achieve more in the future.

				</div>
				<div class="headerboxindex">
					<h4>Goal: Increase your level.&nbsp;</h4>
				</div>
				<p>
					You can formulate an achievement map, or
					&lsquo;star plot&rsquo; by choosing five or more
					areas that you want to work to develop at this
					time. You can choose these from the reference page
					titled Major Areas of Achievement or create your
					own.
				</p>
				<div class="headerboxindex">
					<p>
						Here are some examples of Major Areas of
						Achievement:
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="callout" style="display: flex">
					<div class="callouttext1">
						<p><strong>Trust</strong></p>
						<p>
							<strong>Spiritual Growth</strong>
						</p>
						<p><strong>Networking</strong></p>
					</div>
					<div class="callouttext1">
						<p><strong>Wealth</strong></p>
						<p>
							<strong>Relationships</strong>
						</p>
						<p><strong>Resiliency</strong></p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					The next step is to look at the reference ranking
					systems and decide what level you would say you
					have already achieved. This is just a personal
					assessment, and there are no right answers. For
					example, you may have achieved:
				</p>
				<div class="callout" style="display: flex">
					<div class="callouttextlist">
						<ul>
							<li>Individual Commerce Level 2</li>
							<li>Individual Domicile Level 3</li>
							<li>Domicile Outreach Level 4</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Write your current levels in the areas you have
					chosen in the outlined title boxes on your Areas
					Of Development page. Now, for each of your 6
					areas, create your own &lsquo;steps to
					achievement&rsquo;. This is a list of 3-5 steps
					you can take forward in each chosen Major Area of
					your life. Reference the Minor Achievements Page,
					or make your own. Choose achievements that you are
					excited to reach! Then, order them in any loose
					logical progression. Fill these out under each
					header box of your Areas Of Development page. For
					example:
				</p>

				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttitle">
						<p>
							<strong> Networking Level 3:</strong>
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="callouttextlist">

							</li>
							<li>
								Promotes anarchist meetups and reminds
								people of them.
							</li>
							<li>Employs another anarchist.</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Use these ordered lists of goals to create your
					web, noting what level you are starting from as
					well as what level you are hoping to achieve.
