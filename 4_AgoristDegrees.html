				<h3>Level Up Your Freedom</h3>

				<p>
					<em
						>"The only way to deal with an unfree world is
						to become so absolutely free that your very
						existence is an act of rebellion."</em
					>
					— Albert Camus
				</p>
				<p>
					"Agorist Degrees" is a unique self-assessment tool
					designed to help you map out your personal journey
					of unplugging from coercive systems and actively
					contributing to the creation of robust, voluntary
					alternatives.
				</p>
				<p>
					The best way to take down the state is to live
					your life as an act of rebellion. Agorism has been
					around as long as humanity has. This is a guide to
					look at your life choices through that lens.
				</p>
				<p>
					Agorism is a free-market anarchist philosophy that
					advocates achieving freedom through nonviolent and
					peaceful black market and grey market economics.
					Agorist Degrees help you look at your life choices
					through this lens—a self-assessment tool designed
					to help you map out options for unplugging from
					coercive systems and building voluntary
					alternatives. Think of it as an anarchist version
					of a New Year's resolution list.
				</p>
				<p>
					This does not prescribe any specific action. We
					have suggestions here and more information in
					other publications on how you can achieve your
					goals without changing every single aspect of your
					life.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong
						>The main question we are focused on is: Are you
						living your life in a way that, should others
						follow your example, would eventually lead to
						the abolishment of the slavery that is
						government?</strong
					>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>A Path Forward</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					<em
						>We only need a certain amount of people to
						change their actions to defund the state and to
						create, fund, and help grow agorist
						alternatives</em
					>. You can create spaces of freedom in the world
					today!
				</p>
				<p>
					We are encouraging people to assess themselves on
					several areas of their life. They can use these
					pages, if they choose, to do a self assessment on
					several areas of their choice. This can be used to
					create a 'star plot' or graph resembling a web on
					which they are or ought to be spending their
					energy.
				</p>
				<p>
					If our energy is being put towards endeavors that
					do not create lasting results in our lives, we
					need to explore options that better suit our needs
					and desires. Most people don't have the means
					currently to live the exact calling they feel they
					are here to do, or even utilize what they imagine
					would be the most effective use of their time and
					energy. However, agorism provides a much greater
					chance of success with these desires.
				</p>
				<p>
					This guide is a way for those who participate in
					the assessment to notate what they have achieved
					so far and to brainstorm actionable ways to
					achieve more in the future.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>How to Use Agorist Degrees</h2>
				</div>

				<div class="headerbox">
					<h4>Goal: Increase your level.</h4>
				</div>
				<p>
					You can formulate an achievement map, or 'star
					plot' by choosing five or more areas that you want
					to work to develop at this time. You can choose
					these from the Major Areas of Achievement listed
					below or create your own.
				</p>

				<div class="headerbox">
					<p>Examples of Major Areas of Achievement:</p>
				</div>
				<div class="callout">
					<div style="display: flex; gap: 40px">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Trust</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Spiritual Growth</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Networking</strong></p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p><strong>Wealth</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Relationships</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Resiliency</strong></p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					The next step is to look at the reference ranking
					systems below and decide what level you would say
					you have already achieved. This is just a personal
					assessment, and there are no right answers. For
					example, you may have achieved:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>Individual Commerce Level 2</li>
						<li>Individual Domicile Level 3</li>
						<li>Domicile Outreach Level 4</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>
					Write your current levels in the areas you have
					chosen. Now, for each of your chosen areas, create
					your own 'steps to achievement'. This is a list of
					3-5 steps you can take forward in each Major Area
					of your life. Reference the levels below, or make
					your own. Choose achievements that you are excited
					to reach! Then, order them in any loose logical
					progression.
				</p>

				<p>For example:</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttitle">
						<p><strong>Networking Level 3:</strong></p>
					</div>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Actively works to bring awareness of real
							solutions to others.
						</li>
						<li>
							Promotes anarchist meetups and reminds people
							of them.
						</li>
						<li>Employs another anarchist.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

				<p>
					Use these ordered lists of goals to create your
					web, noting what level you are starting from as
					well as what level you are hoping to achieve.
				</p>
