						Did you just have an interaction
						that didn&rsquo;t make sense? With
						someone illogical towards you and
						you didn&rsquo;t feel that recourse
						could have led to a positive
						conclusion? Come to our camp!<br /><br />
						We are philosophical detectives and
						vibe resetters.<br /><br />
						We are here to get to the bottom of
						things. We are for philosophical
						truth. We do not aim to mete out
						justice or repercussion. We simply
						are here to ascertain the
						truth.&nbsp;
						<br /><br />Does your conversation
						need space and perspective? We want
						to hear! Our listeners are very
						dispassionate. We will show you the
						structure and then you can decide
						whether this is a service you could
						benefit from.

						>How to bring consent along to your
						next conversation</strong
					>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Are you worried the people in your life
					won&rsquo;t have consensual
					conversations with you? You&rsquo;re not
					alone. Every day, people initiate
					conversations and are not able to
					ascertain what the other person is
					consenting to and they just keep going.
					We have a card you can hand out to
					people that explains the basics:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<p>
						Text of Card: Consent is willing,
						positive cooperation in an act or
						the expression of a desire to engage
						in an activity.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					You have to have this conversation with
					anyone you want to engage in consensual
					conversations with?&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>You could begin by saying:</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ve been trying to be
					more consensual with the conversations
					I&rsquo;ve been having. This is what
					I&rsquo;ve learned.&ldquo;
				</p>
				<p>Etc.</p>
				<p>
					Try not to offend your friends by
					accusing them of non-consensual
					relationship or conversation habits.
					It&rsquo;s a two-way street, and they
					may have been wrong in the past but as
					long as you can start from a certain
					agreement, there may be good enough will
					for you to go forward after having any
					amount of nonconsensual conversations in
					the past.
				</p>
				<p>
					If this is someone you do not have the
					opportunity to begin a consensual
					conversation within the previous method,
					there are other methods to encourage
					this behavior without saying it straight
					out. You could tell them what it is you
					value in conversation, and especially
					how that informs your conversation style
					and preferences. Make sure you do indeed
					have a reason you are in the
					conversation. There is also a booklet to
					help you articulate your values.
				</p>
				<p>
					No matter how things have become this
					way, the way forward is peaceful
					resolution.
				</p>
				<p>
					Peaceful, strategic, and uncompromising.
