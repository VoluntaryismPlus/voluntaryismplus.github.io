			<h1>Welcome Desk</h1>
			<div class="innersection">
				<p>
					A welcome desk is a location that anyone who wants
					to learn more about the network can come to or
					reach out to in order to learn more about the
					network and the pathways towards achieving a new
					life within it.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are providing 24-hour in-person support and a
					welcome desk in every city.
				</p>
				<h2>How to get started</h2>
				<p>
					The
					<a href="pathway.html">Choose Your Path</a>
					page is a resource that will show you different
					paths you can take in order to get aquainted or
					get deeper into the network.
				</p>

				</div>
				<p>
					The true realm encompasses the following areas:
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>Inner Realm</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					The rule here is very important: no rulers. Zero
					Aggression Principle. No coercion. There are many
					ways to explain this number one rule. The inner
					realm is protected because some things in life
					need to be protected. Risks are necessary, but we
					don’t need to risk everything. So we keep a
					certain amount of spaces private to people who
					have not expressed an understanding of our Network
					and the nonaggression principle.
				</p>
				<p>
					The entrance to the network’s Inner Realm is
					through Admissions. There are many ways to
					establish yourself as a trusted member of the
					network. You can go through a Network Host, join a
					caravan, or study the library to gain the
					knowledge required to pass through Admissions.
					Feel free to apply at any time.
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>Inter Realm</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					Wherever the caravan goes is the inter realm. We
					are always traveling to outer city outposts and
					any other location with our bus, the signage doing
					much of the activism for us. This is all for
					people to understand that they have to translate
					their life into this place. It is not a way to
					escape a lack of meaning, but it is a path towards
					finding the best possible vocation and living
					situation.
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>Outer Realm</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					The outer realm is what we enter into whe we do
					outreach. It is the space you occupy when you are
					behind enemy lines and there aren't many other
					agorists around to maintain much more than a
					bubble of freedom around you.

								<h4>Level 3: Preferred Network</h4>
								Those from level 2 who also prioritize
