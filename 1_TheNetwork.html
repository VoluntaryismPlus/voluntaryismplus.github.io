					Given we are all equal in rights, what is wrong
					for one is wrong for all. This basic truth applied
					consistently results in a world where all goods,
					services, associations, institutions,
					interactions, etc. are voluntary.
				</p>
				<p>
					This website serves as a guide for the
					establishment of the basic infrastructure
					necessary to create and maintain this voluntary
					world of tomorrow.

						<em>Morality and Ethics</em>
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Some view morality as a dangerous and subjective
					endeavor. But not all moral frameworks are equal.
					The moral philosophy of Voluntaryism is simple and
					unpresumtuous.
				</p>
				<p>
					Voluntaryism, at its core, is a philosophy
					centered on the fundamental principle that all
					human interßaction should be consensual and
					non-coercive. Unlike many traditional frameworks
					that delineate a broad spectrum of "right" and
					"wrong" actions or thoughts, Voluntaryism uniquely
					focuses its evaluative lens almost exclusively on
					the initiation of force or fraud. It does not
					proscribe personal choices, lifestyles, or
					beliefs, no matter how unconventional, so long as
					they do not infringe upon the equal freedom of
					others. In essence, Voluntaryism's primary concern
					is not to dictate virtue or personal conduct, but
					rather to establish a clear boundary against
					actions that forcibly diminish another
					individual's autonomy.
				</p>
				<p>
					A moral principle or code must be universally
					applicable and unchanging. That said, many large
					institutions of this world seek to obfuscate and
					seduce us into accepting that some human beings
					get to act as if they have rights they do not.
					Because we have allowed our world to get to the
					current state of human emergency, a solution must
					be pioneered out of a life of subjugation through
					compulsory taxes and compulsory regulation.

					<h3>
						<em>The Illusion of Delegated Rights</em>
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Most are convinced that the rules of the game we
					call our current society are immutable. They
					believe that even if there are unjust laws, the
					only option is to obey and self-enforce those
					laws. This way of thinking is based in fear of the
					repercussions of acting outside of the boundaries
					of our current system. This fear is understandable
					when there is not a well-known tradition and
					pathway towards living a life unfettered by unjust
					laws.
				</p>
				<p>
					You own yourself and have the right to choose who
					you will and will not associate with, pay tribute
					to, or be subject to. This simple understanding
					constitutes the framework from which we have built
					our moral code of conduct. You cannot delegate
					rights you don't have. No individual nor group of
					individuals can decide for another person what
					they consent to. You do not have the right to
					enslave, rob, or murder another individual, but in
					this society, many pretend to delegate these
					"rights" none of us possess to individuals called
					"elected officials" and their enforcers called
					"police" and their monopolized injustice system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Acknowledging these facts can cause complex
					emotions regarding the current state of the world.
					Unlike what we are led to believe, we are not
					powerless to change this world and our lives for
					the better. We choose to rally around a common
					cause as opposed to a common enemy. Freedom, to
					us, is not only about not being bound by the
					current monstrous systems. Freedom is also
					measured by the ability to conduct your
					consensual, voluntary affairs as you see fit
					without repercussions.
				</p>
				<!--
				<div class="imagenoborder">
					<img src="img/Imposition%20of%20Force.png" />
				</div>
				-->
				<p>
					On an individual level, our lifestyle allows us to
					remove ourselves from many of the unnecessary
					taxes and regulations on our lives that most
					people suffer from, and our goal is to pioneer,
					provision access to, and foster a parallel
					network, a way of life, and counter-economy of
					morally-conscious individuals.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are still countless voluntary paths and
					professions that are blocked by the current
					system. It should be easy and available for anyone
					to enter into a profession they desire, or to
					create an entirely new profession for themselves
					without unnecessary bloated restrictions, allowing
					for the free market to deliver goods and services
					based on consumer desires. There is a way forward,
					and we are the ones to create it.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>
						<em>Current Limiting Structural Beliefs</em>
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					There is a perception held by some that there is
					little opportunity for those who desire autonomy
					and freedom. And this is both true and not true.
					Currently, many things are in the way of people
					doing what they would do otherwise.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					There are laws that restrict these things, and
					people&rsquo;s fears are valid. We don&rsquo;t
					need people to be breaking the law on their own.
					We need to make safer decisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The main thing that we are not seeing in the
					literature available today is many people talking
					about the power that we have right now as a group
					of millions of individuals or even hundreds of
					thousands who understand what needs to be done and
					how easy it will be to free the rest of the world
					from slavery by government.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					We see the possibility that comes with each
					person. There is so much more possibility for each
					person who understands the network, but when you
					add certain constraints, you can yield very potent
					results. Those who want to participate in these
					constraints are considered to be part of the
					&lsquo;engine&rsquo;. For those outside of the
					engine, there is much more we can connect on
					(human sovereignty) than what divides us.&nbsp;
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3 id="section1.2">
						<em>The Current Lies</em>
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Institutions that initiate or threaten to initiate
					force against the person or property of others
					have no right to exist. Therefore, the
					authority-based power structures that call
					themselves &ldquo;The State&rdquo; have no right
					to exist. (they should not exist and are not
					necessary for any positive paradigm shifts from
					now on) //
				</p>
				<p>
					These institutions would have never gained power
					if not for murder, lies, and deception. The only
					strategy they utilize to solve problems is the use
					and threat of violence. There is no argument for
					authority that makes sense because we are all
					equal in rights and none can possess extra rights
					to do things that are wrong for others to do.
					//For something to be a moral principle, it must
					be universally applicable. This is the universal
					ethic axiom, otherwise it&rsquo;s not really an
					ethic. It is always wrong to initiate or threaten
					to initiate force against the person or property
					of other peaceful people.

						<strong
							>What is lacking in the current
							ideology?</strong
						>
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Countless people throughout the world are
					committed to attaining higher levels of freedom
					for themselves, and many are also passionate about
					the freedom of others. We already have the
					infrastructure necessary to sustain freedom for
					more and more people right now. The thing that has
					been lacking in other plans we see is a simple and
					wide-scale solution. The clear, ideologically
					simple idea of freedom for all people without
					adherence to one system or another. The means to
					transition from a state of surviving to one of
					thriving. The Network is here to bring the
					coordination necessary to completely defund the
					systems we do not consent to.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a lack of discussion on the specifics of
					how voluntaryism can lead from this state to the
					next state within our lifetime.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is good to speak of the unknown nature of the
					polycentric outcomes that will take place in a
					free society. However, this does not mean there
					will not be some specific events that lead towards
					the adoption of this new world.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					There are enough voluntaryists already that if
					they all did something cohesively, the example
					they made would become visible to the larger
					public.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then it is the actual free nature of voluntaryism
					itself that would enable many more people to
					become aware of the efficacy of this way of
					living.&nbsp;
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3 id="section4.4">
						What can we do about the current
						&ldquo;State&rdquo; of affairs?
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					We need to imagine a feasible transition from the
					state we are in now to a new state. Not having
					this vision is a huge reason why people become
					inactive or disillusioned within their current
					communities.
				</p>
				<p>
					People fall victim to the mentality that certain
					things aren&rsquo;t &lsquo;realistic&rsquo; or
					practical and that certain outcomes are virtually
					impossible in our lifetimes. The only time change
					is not possible is if enough people continue to
					believe it is not possible and choose to do
					nothing.
				</p>
				<p>
					The high-level overview of our plan goes like
					this:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">
						<ol>
							<li>
								Those who already know about voluntaryism
								are all we need to make this happen. They
								redirect all of their resources of labor and
								thought to the free world, with a purely
								agorist marketplace and protected living
								spaces where all interactions exist free of

					time to time venturing to private campgrounds for
					freedom-respecting festivals.
				</p>
				<p>
					We don’t need to convince more people that this
					way of living is viable. There are already enough
					people who have seen the vision of how a free and
					voluntary society would work - if every one of
					them started living their life in this new way, we
					would make a big enough impact to gain the
					attention of the rest of the world. This is not
					another intentional community. This is a strategy
					towards creating freedom for all that can be
					adopted by every person immediately. There is no
					central location or leader that can be taken down.
					Like an idea, it can only spread.

					We do not need to escape this world. We have

					becomes the ideal world for each individual. How
					can each person have their own ideal coexisting
					with every other person&rsquo;s ideal,
					simultaneously? The answer is voluntary pluralism.
				</p>
				<p>
					To get a more concise and potent result, we are
					more concise with our parameters. We are not
					judging those who do not follow these parameters,
					but we are making a distinction within our own
					decisions to do business with others who are
					actively creating more freedom for others instead
					of creating only a space for themselves to
					temporarily reduce their own oppression while
					doing little to manifest or support protected free
					markets.

				<p>
					This is a guide to the establishment of a society

				<p>
					<em
						>The worst evil is people still believing and
						perpetuating the lie that their neighbors must
						be controlled by the government. No individual
						or group of individuals can possess authority,
						or “the right to rule”, over others. You own

						and labor, which can be thought of as an
						extension of yourself on this planet.</em

				</p>
				<p>
					Our plan is to provide people with options to
					transfer their work and living situations into a
					new realm or state of existence where they are not
					bound by government systems of control.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your way of living should be an act of rebellion
					that helps make people’s choice for freedom a
					no-brainer.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have a method to support and bolster the supply
					of goods and services by providing an ever-growing
					supply and demand for these resources. This is
					accomplished through intentional networking and
					establishing trade relationships and contracts
					with individuals who share our aim of bringing
					about the best of all possible worlds by making
					the world more free for others. We also aim to
					minimize if not eliminate altogether the number of
					fiscal transactions we engage in with unknown or
					unvetted individuals, especially those who haven’t
					demonstrated a desire to be free from the taxes
					and regulations imposed on them by the State.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many ways in which this plan is unique
					to any we have seen so far. The unique attributes
					of our plan provide a strength and resilience that
					helps it transcend the pitfalls of other
					initiatives and businesses. Unlike a proposal that
					requires massive funding to get off the ground, we
					already have much of the infrastructure needed in
					place. All that is needed is to transition
					businesses that are funding the tax system into
					the new, free realm. There are no extra start up
					costs to create a business in the network - no
					fancy degrees or licenses are needed. Vending,
					selling, trading, and providing your good or
					service is free of compulsory licensure or fees.
					This initiative is aimed at people who are already
					trying to make a living and who already have
					resources invested in themselves and could benefit
					from shifting their business towards a tax-free
					network that will provide them with opportunities
					for growth, a greater sense of purpose and
					connection with their customers, and lasting
					prosperity.
				</p>
				<p>
					What we are describing is a lifestyle and
					resource-allocation strategy. The more people are
					empowered by these strategies, the stronger they
					become and the more everyone involved benefits.
					The success of the network is not tied to any
					individual’s success. We (Caravanarchy) identify
					as “network support”. Others can replace our role
					should some tragedy befall our specific wing of
					support.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Success looks like a network that can provide
					people with what they need to make their lives
					better in the absence of compulsory fees or
					restrictions getting between suppliers and
					customers. This results in alternate income
					streams, careers, training, and education. A
					multitude of options of superior value become
					available from this strategy when it comes to
					food, supplies, and services. Alternate
					healthcare, insurance, arbitration as well as
					alternate entertainment venues and community
					meeting spaces become available to more
					individuals as the network grows.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are creating this guidebook and an online
					presence that will do much more to help those
					specific individuals who want to make a change and
					commit to these endeavors in a way that makes a
					difference. Join us in creating a world immune
					from institutionalized tyranny!

				</div>
				<p>
					Our model does not require capital to run. It is a
					framework that can be applied to help others
					better utilize their time and resources toward
					safeguarding freedom. What we need is not
					donations but people on the ground, explaining
					what is possible and available to us right now and
					also creating the next level of possibilities.
					This network will help those seeking protected
					free markets to transition from a state of
					surviving to one of thriving.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eventually, the network will provide a place for
					everyone. This is a path away from everything
					unsatisfactory about their current way of living.
					Whether they want to learn a trade in an Guild,
					start their own Guild or profession, or just live
					free on land arbitrated by no ruler, there are
					countless reasons why choosing freedom for
					yourself is an obvious and beneficial path. Life
					can be easier, more profitable and there is more
					time in the day when the fruits of your productive
					energy aren&rsquo;t being siphoned away into the
					wasteful and unethical games of politicians and
					well-meaning voters. Similarly, there is more
					incentive to work when you know your labor is
					going towards something that will support you more
					and more as time goes on. We will share more on
					that in the next chapter.

					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					We are not creating the network. The network
					exists already, though small. The full potential
					of the network will manifest when it is given the
					right push and intention. Instead, you can see us
					as network support. We are devoting our entire
					lives and livelihoods to creating a stronger bond
					between those who are already constituting the
					network and encouraging a larger vision for how we
					can take on the needs of our dispersed
					freedom-supporting community members and markets
					in every way.
				</p>
				<p>
					A peaceful society is possible based on a truly
					simple concept: that no man should aggress upon
					another or their property as an extension of their
					existence in this realm. All Guilds between
					individuals or groups must be voluntary and
					consensual. No person or group of persons should
					be given the freedom to aggress. Justice comes
					from restitution, so victims must be free to exact
					restitution from their aggressor(s). Individuals
					who are the targets of aggression should not be
					prevented from the exercise of defensive force in
					opposition. We recognize this as the
					Non-Aggression Principle (NAP) paired with the
					Self-Defense Principle (SDP) and the Principle of
					Restitution (PoR). We can pave the way for an
					organic and voluntary society based on these
					precepts alone, but to do that requires more than
					just encouraging each person to spread a culture
					of voluntaryism in their current immediate
					surroundings. Even small communities of
					voluntaryists can not create a voluntaryist
					society in the larger world unless they share a
					larger vision for freedom beyond their own domain
					and take action to join and help create the
					network of protected free markets.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you make your voluntary groupings, make sure
					to look at what is created. Are you producing more
					freedom for others beyond your circle? This is not
					an altruistic approach but promotes a realistic
					understanding of how each smaller group relies
					upon an interconnected network in order to
					survive. Not only does every group interact with
					the larger society in some large or small ways
					that affect their life and well-being outside of
					their control, but any one group cannot get all of
					their needs met by their individual members. You
					need to import products and services. To do this,
					you must expand your inner network to collaborate
					with others in your broader community who share in
					your desire to create safe and thriving free
					markets and establish protected and trusted trade
					and social networks.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also understand that the stress of high
					mortgages and &ldquo;taxes&rdquo; (government
					extortion) makes wealth accumulation more
					difficult and that is why we are creating the
					infrastructure (the bounty board, helping to meet
					the needs of our network of individuals intent on
					protecting and supporting a free way of life) to
					create affordable housing and jobs that pay more
					while not extorting taxes from the people
					involved. Nobody will be turned away for lack of
					funds. Instead, we will select our allegiances
					based on the goal and vision of each individual.

					Every organization or organism has parameters it
					is working to achieve and maintain. Another
					similarity between these two is that like an
					organism, the way an organization is formed and
					the mechanisms that bring it to life will
					determine the outcome it achieves in its
					environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is why we have the engine. We are creating a
					bulletproof mechanism and strategy, so that even
					if large parts of it are destroyed, all it needs
					is one hearth, aka one wing of the network, to
					light up in some distant land and our engine is
					going again.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="outerimage">
				<img src="img/engine2.jpeg" />
			</div>
			<div class="innersection">
				<p>
					We do not need any one leg of the engine to
					survive continuously for the engine to roll on.
					Any single hearth can turn its engine on and off,
					but there will always be more engines firing and
					producing the change we need to move past the
					current binds we live under and into a realm of
					voluntaryism for all.
				</p>
				<p>
					When we create certain additional criteria for our
					interactions in addition to the NAP (which already
					underlies all of our interactions) we assure that
					our interactions will make the largest impact
					possible in the community that supports us.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					We need a community to support us in these ways:
					security, backups, community, etc. The everyday
					society we have come to know is not providing for
					us in the ways we need, and we are being led to
					erroneously think ourselves powerless over our
					current state of mass-human-enslavement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having a protected community requires vigilance,
					decentralization, sound principles, and a
					plurality of voluntary strategies aimed at meeting

				</h5>
				<p>
					A majority of the people we meet are interested in
					settling down on property and growing their own
					food. The logic in this endeavor is infinitely
					sound. However, one of the biggest struggles for
					farmers who have the desire to progress beyond
					their own sustenance and to make money doing what
					they love is finding the market for the goods and
					services they wish to provide - both outside and
					inside their farmstead.
				</p>
				<p>
					Farming and producing goods are very desirable
					endeavors as opposed to making money from
					something unrelated to your efforts to exist in a
					healthy and positive way. It is hard to find new
					customers when farms are often hours from major
					cities, and the money they would have to spend on
					gas to drive and sell their goods can cut a
					sizable chunk out of their profits, not to mention
					taking time away from the tasks they must complete
					to keep the farm running.
				</p>
				<p>
					As full-time nomads, the money we spend on gas is
					already subsidized by the sheer amount of goods we
					are bringing from one place to another. We make
					sure that every time we move, we are making money
					simply by moving: for example, we provide
					rideshare and package delivery to supplement our
					travels if there is a questionable business
					opportunity on the other end.

					This website is to help you figure out your next

					The bounty board and social boards connect
					individuals with available resources. Without the
					leeching and constraint of the state, everyone can
					live a free and fulfilling life they can be proud
					of. This requires discipline, intention, and a
					willingness to adapt one's lifestyle toward
					bringing about a more free world for themselves
					and others. It will also require our continued
					vigilance in keeping our markets safe from
					aggressors.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are cultivating a world of decentralized and

					equals; because that is the only possible just
					future. There is no free world in which force or

					Because of the concise nature of our plan, the
					outcome of this is going to be something more
					abundant than seems possible in these bleak times.

				<p>
					Those who participate will enjoy the bounty
					once-stolen from them by the State, while enjoying
					a market constantly on the lookout for aggressors.
					They will enjoy a higher standard of living not
					only concerning material wealth, but also in that
					of social wealth and resilience gained through
					intentional networking. Participation can be done
					on many levels, both overtly and covertly.

					<h2>How You Can Spread Freedom</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					We support people in translating their lifestyle
					away from the tax system and into the network. In
					order to fully detach, you must reclaim your
					income, housing, business and expenditures. There
					are many resources on this site to help you
					transition into a new life. You can start
					<a href="4.1_StartHere.html">here</a>
					or keep reading to get the full picture.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are not ready to transition in one or more
					of these areas, you can still spread freedom where
					you are by employing the following strategies.
				</p>
				<p>
					This also applies to individuals who do not want
					to leave their current area but still wants to
					grow the network around them.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">
						<h4>Freedom Through Goods and Services</h4>
						<p>
							If you want to spread freedom in your area,
							start by identifying a need people have for a
							good or service and find someone who is
							willing to meet that need. Work with that
							person to create a model where they are able
							to produce a good or provide a service at a
							cost and value that is comparable to the
							market rate but without funding or complying
							with the state in any way.
						</p>
						<br />
						<h4>Freedom Through Housing</h4>
						<p>
							Find ways of circumventing the state through
							providing tax-free shelter for those who are
							also actively trying to create and grow the
							network. The easiest way to do this is to
							create a caravan outside of a city or town
							where the caravan members support each other
							in taking advantage of the amenities of the
							city or town. Members can earn income remotely
							or through interactions with the people of the
							town.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can also create an
							<a href="“7.5_Innercity.html”">inner-city</a>
							or
							<a href="“7.4_Outercity.html”"
								>outer-city outpost</a
							>
							to support visiting caravans and provide a way
							out for people still stuck in the system.
						</p>
						<p>
							A third option would be to become a
							<a href="2.2_NetworkHosts.html"
								>Network Host</a
							>
							and help those trying to gain a new position
							in the network.
						</p>
						<br />
						<h4>Grow Your Network</h4>
						<p>
							The most effective way to grow your network is
							to find people both local and remote to
							collaborate with on creating new offerings in
							the network.
						</p>
						<p>
							To find these contacts, you can search within
							the network via the options on this page:<br />
						</p>
						<h5 style="text-align: center">
							<a href="connections.html"
								>Connections Page</a
							>
						</h5>
						<p>
							To source new contacts in your area, spread
							word of the network with those you meet.
							Identify others who are looking for ways to be
							more free. This includes both friends in
							freedom and trusted individuals who are both
							trade and social contacts.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can also create meetups and marketspaces
							to discuss options, form and execute plans,
							and conduct trade with those who attend. If
							nomadic, such spaces should be created when
							possible, or you can locate a preexisting
							space near you to make contact and trade with
							others in the network. If stationary, the aim
							is to have a regular network meeting and
							market space available near you.

					Keeping the Money in the Network
				</h3>
				<p>
					If you want to trade or give, put your resources
					into people who will make us all more free. When
					you provide goods or services to others, what does
					your energy and time result in? Does it go into a
					network whose growth directly helps and protects
					you, or do your efforts end up funding the state
					down the line?
				</p>
				<p>
					To answer the above question, it is imperative
					that you consider your business contacts and
					customer base. When those you work and do business
					with go back into their lives, are they using the
					energy produced by your trade to create more
					freedom for others? Or are they spending their
					time working within the confines of the State,
					bleeding their energy into its evil machinery
					through their income, housing and other
					interactions?

					It makes more sense to provide goods and services

					When we work within the private realm and don’t
					spend our resources on government licenses and
					taxes, there are more resources concentrated
					within the Network of freedom-bringers. This
					brings the price for Network goods down, making
					them more accessible and allows them a competitive
					advantage over the Matrix market. Networks can
					provide these high-value goods and services to
					those still stuck in the Matrix, introducing them
					to the abundance of the Network without requiring
					them to understand the philosophy. This results in
					stronger, larger agorist networks and market
					opportunities.

					Be discerning when you offer help to someone. It

					It’s too much of a risk to spend money or give to
					charity when you cannot ensure it won’t bleed back
					into the State. This includes giving to
					individuals who aren’t making the world more free
					for others. If you give to someone without knowing
					what that person is doing with their resources,
					you are saying “I don’t matter. My time doesn’t
					matter and my efforts are for nothing”. Money can
					be thought of as a source of potential energy, and
					you get to choose what that energy will support.
				</p>
				<p>
					You only have one moment, and endless options for
					where to put your time, energy and resources. If
					you want to grow a network that will become
					prosperous and protect your future, support those
					whose actions lead towards freedom and prosperity
					for all instead of towards making themselves more
					comfortable within a cage.
				</p>
				<p>
					Everyone you give to can be seen as a river of
					potential. If you toss resources into a river,
					throw them into one that leads to freedom for
					others instead of towards apathy and inaction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vote with your wallet. Create the world you want
					to see. It doesn’t help in our economic war
					against the State to give energy or resources to
					people who aren’t trying to make the world more
					free for others. There are people who want a
					better option and who see that there is a need to
					put their money into a network that ensures the
					safety of their person, property, and freedom. The
					Network provides them with an option that they
					desperately need. This is a network that is able
					to protect their physical security and the
					products of their labor in a way that is missing
					in the current paradigm.

						<h4>Prudent Discrimination</h4>
						<p>
							Discriminate against people who are working to
							reduce human freedom, be it actively or
							through vocal support. If you have a different
							opinion than someone, look at whether their
							opinion requires others to lose their freedom.
							If you are not sure, ask them directly where
							they draw their line between what they will or
							won't allow from those who think differently
							from them. Do they believe people who think
							differently should be free to take different
							actions and fund different initiatives, while
							being free to opt out of funding things they
							did not choose or support?

							<br /><br />Discrimination does not
							necessarily imply ex-communication. Rather, it
							is about prioritizing interactions and
							exchanges based on your own framework of
							judgement. It is always better to give your
							time and energey toward people who are working
							to make the world more free for others, rather
							than less free.
