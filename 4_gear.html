        <p>
          Living a life on the road offers unparalleled
          freedom and adventure. This guide provides
          practical solutions for meeting your essential
          needs, from the physical necessities of daily
          living to the emotional and social well-being that
          sustains a truly unbound lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're planning to go full nomad or just
          want to increase your resilience and independence,
          understanding how to meet basic needs without
          relying on conventional infrastructure is
          essential. This page covers both minimal-budget
          solutions and more robust setups for long-term
          mobile living.

        <h2>Physical Needs</h2>
        <p>
          These are the non-negotiable basics: water, food,
          shelter, waste management, and cleanliness. Each
          has minimal-budget options for starting out and

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>Minimal Build:</strong> For those
            prioritizing simplicity, 5-gallon containers are
            an accessible starting point. These can be
            refilled at a variety of locations, from public
            parks to grocery stores, and are easy to
            transport and manage. Filtration can involve
            simple, portable devices like pump filters or
            gravity filters, ensuring potable water from
            diverse sources. <br /><br />
            <strong>Maximal Build:</strong> A more robust
            solution involves a water pump system integrated
            into your vehicle. This can draw water from a
            larger onboard tank, providing a continuous
            supply for drinking, cooking, and hygiene,
            offering greater convenience and
            self-sufficiency for extended periods off-grid.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Storage capacity matters:</strong>
                  More capacity = more flexibility in where
                  you can camp
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Filtration is essential:</strong>
                  Don't rely on finding clean sources
                  everywhere
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Know your refill spots:</strong>
                  Apps and network members can help you
                  locate water sources
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Consider dual systems:</strong>
                  One for drinking/cooking, another for
                  washing/cleaning

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>Minimal Build:</strong> For the most
            resource-efficient approach, free food boxes and
            strategic dumpster diving can provide a
            surprising amount of edible sustenance,
            minimizing costs and waste. This often requires
            research and adaptability to local resources and
            regulations. Many grocery stores discard
            perfectly good food due to cosmetic
            imperfections or approaching sell-by dates.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Maximal Build:</strong> A fully equipped
            kitchen offers home-like convenience. This can
            range from a propane stove (indoor or outdoor)
            for versatile cooking, to a propane oven or an
            outdoor wood oven for baking and more elaborate
            meals, enabling a diverse culinary experience
            wherever you are. <br /><br />

                <li>
                  <strong>Dry goods first:</strong> Rice,
                  beans, pasta, oats—long shelf life, cheap,
                  nutritious
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cooler vs refrigerator:</strong>
                  Coolers work initially; 12V fridges are
                  game-changers for long-term
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Local sourcing:</strong> Connect

                  for self-sufficiency
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cooking versatility:</strong>
                  Single-burner propane stove is bare
                  minimum; two-burner plus oven is luxury

            <strong>Minimal Build:</strong> Starting simple
            means embracing agile, low-overhead options.
            This could include bicycle camping for ultimate
            mobility, a car with a tent or hammock for quick

            separates solids and liquids for efficient

          they actually need versus what they thought they'd
          need.
