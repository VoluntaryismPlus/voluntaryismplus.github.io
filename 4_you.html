								Those who already know about

								thought to the free world,
								with a purely agorist
								marketplace and protected
								living spaces where all
								interactions exist free of
								the state.
							</li>
							<li>
								The marketplace flourishes
								and people from the cities
								start coming to our
								marketplaces and our events
								and learning about the real
								applications of voluntaryism
								and how to create, find, or
								access their local network
								of protected free markets.
							</li>
							<li>
								Slowly the state loses its
								grasp on our hearts, minds,
								and resources and we
								transition fully into the
								new realm.

					<h3>The Market Circuit</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					We are creating a perpetual free market
					that will provide a safe space for
					people to buy and sell agorist goods
					without fear of the government. We
					travel from town to town, setting up in
					BLM land, staying for a month or more at
					a time, and from time to time venturing
					to private campgrounds for
					freedom-respecting festivals.
				</p>
				<p>
					We don’t need to convince more people
					that this way of living is viable. There
					are already enough people who have seen
					the vision of how a free and voluntary
					society would work - if every one of
					them started living their life in this
					new way, we would make a big enough
					impact to gain the attention of the rest
					of the world. This is not another
					intentional community. This is a
					strategy towards creating freedom for
					all that can be adopted by every person
					immediately. There is no central
					location or leader that can be taken
					down. Like an idea, it can only spread.

						<strong>Making The Switch</strong>
					</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					We do not need to escape this world. We
					have everything we need here to create
					the next phase of existence. This is the
					world that, in time, becomes the ideal
					world for each individual. How can each
					person have their own ideal coexisting
					with every other person&rsquo;s ideal,
					simultaneously? The answer is voluntary
					pluralism.
				</p>
				<p>
					To get a more concise and potent result,
					we are more concise with our parameters.
					We are not judging those who do not
					follow these parameters, but we are
					making a distinction within our own
					decisions to do business with others who
					are actively creating more freedom for
					others instead of creating only a space
					for themselves to temporarily reduce
					their own oppression while doing little
					to manifest or support protected free
					markets.

				<br />
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h4>
						<em

					</h4>
				</div>
				<p>
					We do not want to spend our lives
					working for other people&rsquo;s goals
					while doing nothing or very little
					toward what we are in this realm to
					achieve, which has nothing to do with
					slaving away for money.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a guide to the establishment of
					a society that is independent,
					interconnected, and free from coercion.
					Today, we have everything we need to
					circumvent the state entirely.
					Communities small and large are already
					flourishing all around the world, and
					what is lacking in the common lore is a
					larger and more liberating story we can
					all manifest into reality.&nbsp;

					The next sections will address the

					<h3>What will success look like?</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					<em
						>The worst evil is people still
						believing and perpetuating the lie
						that their neighbors must be
						controlled by the government. No
						individual or group of individuals
						can possess authority, or “the right
						to rule”, over others. You own your
						self and 100% of the fruits of your
						time and labor, which can be thought
						of as an extension of yourself on
						this planet.</em
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					Our plan is to provide people with
					options to transfer their work and
					living situations into a new realm or
					state of existence where they are not
					bound by government systems of control.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your way of living should be an act of
					rebellion that helps make people’s
					choice for freedom a no-brainer.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have a method to support and bolster
					the supply of goods and services by
					providing an ever-growing supply and
					demand for these resources. This is
					accomplished through intentional
					networking and establishing trade
					relationships and contracts with
					individuals who share our aim of
					bringing about the best of all possible
					worlds by making the world more free for
					others. We also aim to minimize if not
					eliminate altogether the number of
					fiscal transactions we engage in with
					unknown or unvetted individuals,
					especially those who haven’t
					demonstrated a desire to be free from
					the taxes and regulations imposed on
					them by the State.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many ways in which this plan
					is unique to any we have seen so far.
					The unique attributes of our plan
					provide a strength and resilience that
					helps it transcend the pitfalls of other
					initiatives and businesses. Unlike a
					proposal that requires massive funding
					to get off the ground, we already have
					much of the infrastructure needed in
					place. All that is needed is to
					transition businesses that are funding
					the tax system into the new, free realm.
					There are no extra start up costs to
					create a business in the network - no
					fancy degrees or licenses are needed.
					Vending, selling, trading, and providing
					your good or service is free of
					compulsory licensure or fees. This
					initiative is aimed at people who are
					already trying to make a living and who
					already have resources invested in
					themselves and could benefit from
					shifting their business towards a
					tax-free network that will provide them
					with opportunities for growth, a greater
					sense of purpose and connection with
					their customers, and lasting prosperity.
				</p>
				<p>
					What we are describing is a lifestyle
					and resource-allocation strategy. The
					more people are empowered by these
					strategies, the stronger they become and
					the more everyone involved benefits. The
					success of the network is not tied to
					any individual’s success. We
					(Caravanarchy) identify as “network
					support”. Others can replace our role
					should some tragedy befall our specific
					wing of support.
				</p>
				<p>
					Success looks like a network that can
					provide people with what they need to
					make their lives better in the absence
					of compulsory fees or restrictions
					getting between suppliers and customers.
					This results in alternate income
					streams, careers, training, and
					education. A multitude of options of
					superior value become available from
					this strategy when it comes to food,
					supplies, and services. Alternate
					healthcare, insurance, arbitration as
					well as alternate entertainment venues
					and community meeting spaces become
					available to more individuals as the
					network grows.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are creating this guidebook and an
					online presence that will do much more
					to help those specific individuals who
					want to make a change and commit to
					these endeavors in a way that makes a
					difference. Join us in creating a world
					immune from institutionalized tyranny!

					We do not need any one leg of the engine
					to survive continuously for the engine
					to roll on. Any single hearth can turn
					its engine on and off, but there will
					always be more engines firing and
					producing the change we need to move
					past the current binds we live under and
					into a realm of voluntaryism for all.
				</p>
				<p>
					When we create certain additional
					criteria for our interactions in
					addition to the NAP (which already
					underlies all of our interactions) we
					assure that our interactions will make
					the largest impact possible in the
					community that supports us.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					We need a community to support us in
					these ways: security, backups,
					community, etc. The everyday society we
					have come to know is not providing for
					us in the ways we need, and we are being
					led to erroneously think ourselves
					powerless over our current state of
					mass-human-enslavement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having a protected community requires
					vigilance, decentralization, sound
					principles, and a plurality of voluntary
					strategies aimed at meeting needs.

					<h2>How You Can Spread Freedom</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					We support people in translating their
					lifestyle away from the tax system and
					into the network. In order to fully
					detach, you must reclaim your income,
					housing, business and expenditures.
					There are many resources on this site to
					help you transition into a new life. You
					can start
					<a href="4.1_StartHere.html">here</a>
					or keep reading to get the full picture.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are not ready to transition in
					one or more of these areas, you can
					still spread freedom where you are by
					employing the following strategies.
				</p>
				<p>
					This also applies to individuals who do
					not want to leave their current area but
					still wants to grow the network around
					them.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">
						<h4>
							Freedom Through Goods and
							Services
						</h4>
						<p>
							If you want to spread freedom in
							your area, start by identifying
							a need people have for a good or
							service and find someone who is
							willing to meet that need. Work
							with that person to create a
							model where they are able to
							produce a good or provide a
							service at a cost and value that
							is comparable to the market rate
							but without funding or complying
							with the state in any way.
						</p>
						<br />
						<h4>Freedom Through Housing</h4>
						<p>
							Find ways of circumventing the
							state through providing tax-free
							shelter for those who are also
							actively trying to create and
							grow the network. The easiest
							way to do this is to create a
							caravan outside of a city or
							town where the caravan members
							support each other in taking
							advantage of the amenities of
							the city or town. Members can
							earn income remotely or through
							interactions with the people of
							the town.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can also create an
							<a href="“7.5_Innercity.html”"
								>inner-city</a
							>
							or
							<a href="“7.4_Outercity.html”"
								>outer-city outpost</a
							>
							to support visiting caravans and
							provide a way out for people
							still stuck in the system.
						</p>
						<p>
							A third option would be to
							become a
							<a href="2.2_NetworkHosts.html"
								>Network Host</a
							>
							and help those trying to gain a
							new position in the network.
						</p>
						<br />
						<h4>Grow Your Network</h4>
						<p>
							The most effective way to grow
							your network is to find people
							both local and remote to
							collaborate with on creating new
							offerings in the network.
						</p>
						<p>
							To find these contacts, you can
							search within the network via
							the options on this page:<br />
						</p>
						<h5 style="text-align: center">
							<a href="connections.html"
								>Connections Page</a
							>
						</h5>
						<p>
							To source new contacts in your
							area, spread word of the network
							with those you meet. Identify
							others who are looking for ways
							to be more free. This includes
							both friends in freedom and
							trusted individuals who are both
							trade and social contacts.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can also create meetups and
							marketspaces to discuss options,
							form and execute plans, and
							conduct trade with those who
							attend. If nomadic, such spaces
							should be created when possible,
							or you can locate a preexisting
							space near you to make contact
							and trade with others in the
							network. If stationary, the aim
							is to have a regular network
							meeting and market space
							available near you.

					Keeping the Money in the Network
				</h3>
				<p>
					If you want to trade or give, put your
					resources into people who will make us
					all more free. When you provide goods or
					services to others, what does your
					energy and time result in? Does it go
					into a network whose growth directly
					helps and protects you, or do your
					efforts end up funding the state down
					the line?
				</p>
				<p>
					To answer the above question, it is
					imperative that you consider your
					business contacts and customer base.
					When those you work and do business with
					go back into their lives, are they using
					the energy produced by your trade to
					create more freedom for others? Or are
					they spending their time working within
					the confines of the State, bleeding
					their energy into its evil machinery
					through their income, housing and other
					interactions?
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="calloutcenter">
						<p>
							When choosing who to sell to or
							buy from, ask yourself:<br />
							"Who is going to be a targeted
							missile directed towards what I
							would like to achieve?"
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					It makes more sense to provide goods and
					services to people who are keeping their
					energy inside the network so that the
					wealth and prosperity we all share can
					be multiplied instead of pilfered away
					into the enemy’s reserves.
				</p>
				<p>
					When we work within the private realm
					and don’t spend our resources on
					government licenses and taxes, there are
					more resources concentrated within the
					Network of freedom-bringers. This brings
					the price for Network goods down, making
					them more accessible and allows them a
					competitive advantage over the Matrix
					market. Networks can provide these
					high-value goods and services to those
					still stuck in the Matrix, introducing
					them to the abundance of the Network
					without requiring them to understand the
					philosophy. This results in stronger,
					larger agorist networks and market
					opportunities.
				</p>
				<h3 style="margin: 23px 0 5px 0">
					Charity
				</h3>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="calloutcenter">
						<p>
							Everything you do is effort and
							resources. Nothing you possess
							has been received free from
							effort.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Be discerning when you offer help to
					someone. It does the most good to help
					people who are using their life to
					achieve the greatest good, which is
					making the world more free for
					themselves and others.
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s too much of a risk to spend money
					or give to charity when you cannot
					ensure it won’t bleed back into the
					State. This includes giving to
					individuals who aren’t making the world
					more free for others. If you give to
					someone without knowing what that person
					is doing with their resources, you are
					saying “I don’t matter. My time doesn’t
					matter and my efforts are for nothing”.
					Money can be thought of as a source of
					potential energy, and you get to choose
					what that energy will support.
				</p>
				<p>
					You only have one moment, and endless
					options for where to put your time,
					energy and resources. If you want to
					grow a network that will become
					prosperous and protect your future,
					support those whose actions lead towards
					freedom and prosperity for all instead
					of towards making themselves more
					comfortable within a cage.
				</p>
				<p>
					Everyone you give to can be seen as a
					river of potential. If you toss
					resources into a river, throw them into
					one that leads to freedom for others
					instead of towards apathy and inaction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vote with your wallet. Create the world
					you want to see. It doesn’t help in our
					economic war against the State to give
					energy or resources to people who aren’t
					trying to make the world more free for
					others. There are people who want a
					better option and who see that there is
					a need to put their money into a network
					that ensures the safety of their person,
					property, and freedom. The Network
					provides them with an option that they
					desperately need. This is a network that
					is able to protect their physical
					security and the products of their labor
					in a way that is missing in the current
					paradigm.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">
						<h4>Prudent Discrimination</h4>
						<p>
							Discriminate against people who
							are working to reduce human
							freedom, be it actively or
							through vocal support. If you
							have a different opinion than
							someone, look at whether their
							opinion requires others to lose
							their freedom. If you are not
							sure, ask them directly where
							they draw their line between
							what they will or won't allow
							from those who think differently
							from them. Do they believe
							people who think differently
							should be free to take different
							actions and fund different
							initiatives, while being free to
							opt out of funding things they
							did not choose or support?

							<br /><br />Discrimination does
							not necessarily imply
							ex-communication. Rather, it is
							about prioritizing interactions
							and exchanges based on your own
							framework of judgement. It is
							always better to give your time
							and energey toward people who
							are working to make the world
							more free for others, rather
							than less free.
