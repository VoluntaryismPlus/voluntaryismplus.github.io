        <h3>Shared Vision &amp; Active Contribution</h3>
        <p>
          A lasting partnership isn't just about love; it's
          about building a life together. This section is
          for assessing how you and your partner work as a
          team. The questions here will help you reflect on
          whether your relationship is a source of mutual
          empowerment and if you are both actively
          contributing to a shared vision for the future you
          are building.
        </p>
        <p>
          These questions focus on whether partners are
          working together toward common goals and actively
          building a shared life.
        </p>
        <p>
          (This section is all about how you and your
          partner work as a team to build a better life
          together. The questions address how the
          partnership helps each person grow.)
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li>
              To what degree does your relationship empower
              you?
            </li>
            <li>
              Could your life be better? If so, how is your
              partner helping you?
            </li>
            <li>
              Does your partner use their time to attain
              more freedom for both of you?
            </li>
            <li>
              To what degree is your partner an active
              participant in your personal growth and
              fulfillment?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do you and your partner have a shared vision
              for your life together, and are your daily
              actions aligned with that vision?
            </li>
            <li>
              How do you and your partner work together to
              overcome challenges, rather than letting them
              pull you apart?
            </li>
            <li>
              What specific, proactive steps do you take to
              improve your relationship on a regular basis?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Responsibility &amp; Self-Awareness</h3>
        <p>
          In any relationship, your greatest power lies in
          your own ability to take responsibility for your
          thoughts and actions. This section challenges you
          to look inward and honestly assess your own role
          in the partnership. These questions are designed
          to help you reflect on your willingness to grow,
          your commitment to the initial promises you've
          made, and your capacity for self-mastery.
        </p>
        <p>
          (These questions delve into The Intentional
          Partnership's emphasis on individual
          accountability and the "Initial Agreement" to take
          responsibility for one's own feelings and
          actions.)
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li>
              When you have a negative feeling or
              disagreement, do you take responsibility for
              your own thoughts and reactions, or do you
              expect your partner to solve the problem for
              you?
            </li>
            <li>
              How have you changed or grown as a person
              specifically because of your relationship?
            </li>
            <li>
              What "non-negotiables" did you define for your
              relationship, and are you both upholding them?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do you know what your partner's core needs
              are, and are you actively working to meet
              them?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Emotional Connection &amp; Intimacy</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond the day-to-day logistics, a thriving
          relationship is built on a foundation of emotional
          intimacy. This section explores the heart of your
          bond, inviting you to reflect on the depth of your
          connection, the level of trust and safety you
          share, and whether you truly feel known and seen
          by your partner. These questions are designed to
          help you gauge the health and resilience of your
          emotional bond.
        </p>
        <p>
          (These questions explore the emotional depth and
          vulnerability required for a lasting, intimate
          bond.)
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li>
              When was the last time you and your partner
              had a deep, philosophical conversation?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do you feel you can share absolutely anything
              with your partner without fear of judgment?
            </li>
            <li>
              Does your partner's presence bring you a sense
              of security and peace?
            </li>
            <li>
              What specific actions do you take to show your
              partner that you choose them, even when it's
              difficult?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Individual Fulfillment &amp; Well-Being</h3>
        <p>
          A truly great partnership should amplify your
          life, not diminish it. This section encourages you
          to reflect on your personal well-being and whether
          your relationship is a source of freedom,
          authenticity, and personal fulfillment. These
          questions are designed to help you gauge if the
          partnership is a platform for you to live a more
          empowered and fully-expressed life.
        </p>

              freedom-wise?
            </li>
            <li>
              To what degree does your relationship hinder
