					<h3>Networking &amp; Locational Flexibility:</h3>
					<h4>More than just a bug-out plan.</h4>
				</div>

				<p>
					Being nomadic is a supreme strategy to empower the
					invidual to achieve anything they put their mind
					to. It also puts an individual into a unique
					position to establish lines of support in many
					locations. By maintaning supplies, establishing
					trade and developing social networks in multiple
					communities, one can construct real resiliency and
					protection from future threats. This is beyond
					what most stationary people can provide for
					themselves even with of networking in one
					location.
				</p>
				<p>
					Stationary people can gain some of these benefits
					through bursts of travel, but would be wise to
					remain realistic about the dangers they face if
					they put all of their energy into one location
					that may become compromised.
				</p>
				<p>
					Always be prepared to leave your current location
					and survive long-term at a secondary location, if
					not fully nomadically.
				</p>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>The Current State of Van-Lifers</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Many stationary people we meet tell us that they
					have lived a nomadic lifestyle in the past.
				</p>
				<p>
					They then tell us their reasoning for not
					remaining in this life. This is quite a common
					topic, which makes sense because when you choose
					to settle down, you usually have a reason. If you
					don’t have a strong reason, you probably are still
					open to road life as an option.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are lots of things one gets from living in a
					house. You get a stationary place to sleep every
					night, virtually endless running water and
					electricity, your own bathroom, and potentially a
					lot of space to store items. In exchange for these
					amenities, you most likely will sell your soul.
					This means taking on a position in life that
					berays your morals or values in one way or
					another.
				</p>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="img/hamsterwheel.jpeg" />
				</div>
				<p>
					The amount of money needed to sustain a lifestyle
					like this is exorbitant. Some people have found
					their own ways of getting around the taxed and
					regulated 9 to 5, and those aren’t the people that
					we are referring to here.
				</p>
				<p>
					The excuses are endless when it comes to
					justifying our desire for these amenities. But are
					these amenities an equal exchange for what we give
					up in order to afford this type of luxury?
				</p>

				<p>
					The major things we are giving up in order to
					afford rent are our time, energy, and attention.
					After a long day of work, our mind can be
					exhausted to a point that all we have energy for
					is to watch netflix, the news, play a game, or
					read a book. None of these activities will further
					one's life in any meaningful way.
				</p>
				<p>
					A less-acknowledged fact is that there are unique
					luxuries that come with living on the road. Being
					on the road, you never have to clean the toilet if
					you don’t want to maintain one. You know exactly
					how much water and electricity you are using,
					which allows for a prudent and efficient
					lifestyle.
				</p>
				<p>
					You don’t have to wait until worthwhile things
					come to your town, but can bring your home to the
					location where the events you are interested in
					are being held. As expenses are lower, you don't
					have to work as much. You can arrange it so that
					months of your time are stationary, costing you
					almost nothing to live. You can decide how much
					money you spend on gas based on how far you want
					to drive.
				</p>
				<p>
					You aren’t stuck with the same neighbors day in
					and day out - and yet you can choose to travel
					alongside or meet up with the neighbors you really
					want to keep. Being nomadic gives one a true sense
					of freedom in an unfree world because if you
					don&rsquo;t like your situation, you truly can
					leave it.
				</p>
				<h4>Finding Meaning on the Road</h4>
				<p>
					The people who stopped traveling probably did so
					because they couldn’t find enough meaning in life
					on the road. Maybe they were the follower type,
					looking to those around them for direction. Humans
					are social beings, so if the sense was that there
					is no direction or community on the road, people
					who feel powerless to create that community for
					themselves can see the road as not a good option.
				</p>
				<p>
					There aren’t a lot of leaders showing people that
					there is a way of living on the road which is
					meaningful and respectable.
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s easy to meet other travelers, but they always
					seem to be going on their own journeys. They see
					road-life as an opportunity to be independent,
					seek the beauty of nature, and meet people they
					don’t have to keep in touch with in the future.
					This fulfills a certain need for someone who has
					never had the freedom to just exist in their life
					and forger their own path. But it doesn’t have to
					be the only use of road life by any means. The
					effect of this is that traveling is used as the
					self-discovery and spiritual tool, but doesn’t
					provide the long term community and thus the
					holding quality to assure people that they will be
					able to lead a rich and full life as a full-time
					traveler.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ideal is for there to be a multitude of
					traveling caravans that do provide each other an
					amount of stability and community. People can come
					and go from these anchor points as they desire,
					but they don’t have to consider going back to
					stationary life as the only way to start building
					community.
				</p>
				<h4>Why We Are Nomads</h4>
				<p>
					Our choice to be travelers is not based off of a
					desire to be social. We are not searching for
					meaning or a soulmate. We have many direct reasons
					why we will choose to remain nomadic for the
					foreseeable future. Some of these reasons include
					the role we fill in society. Nomads provide a
					source of new information and make connections
					with people wherever they go.
				</p>
				<div class="image"><img src="img/van2.jpeg" /></div>
				<p>
					Nomads can be couriers of objects and goods. They
					can transport people from place to place,
					providing them lodging on the way there. Nomads
					can create events everywhere they go and collect
					unique items to share with others.

					or live and work for yourself (preferably within
					the network), paying minimal rent and your own gas
					while following our caravan. Or you can trade your
					car into the network for barter.
