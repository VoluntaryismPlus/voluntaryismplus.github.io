			<p>
				Currently, there is craigslist which provides basic
				search services for those wanting to buy or sell
				items. The bounty board is more complex and offers
				away for an individual to craft their own "job" out
				of providing for other people's weekly needs. Anyone
				who joins the network will be encouraged to post on
				the bounty board detailed descriptions of what goods
				and services they provide for themselves and
				purchase every week. These will be posted
				semi-anonymously on a map. From there, someone who
				is looking to start a new delivery route will be
				able to construct their delivery system based on the
				needs of those in their chosen area.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, if there were 10 people who would buy
				one dozen eggs per week but currently have to do it
				at the grocery store someone with a vehicle would be
				enabled to find a producer of eggs in the area who
				was able to produce 10 dozen eggs per week. If that
				person wasn’t already existent, the would-be egg
				deliverer could go to anyone and show them the
				demand, even gaining pre-orders from the people
				involved, and invest the small amount of money to
				get that delivery system up and running. People will
				be creating their own schedules, and negative
				experiences will be reported and dealt with
				seriously.
			</p>

			<p>
				When we go to an area, we stay there for a month.
				People in our caravan network with others in the
				town and raise awareness of our marketplace. Staying
				a month ensures that someone just introduced to
				agorism will have time to gain familiarity with our
				presence and is more likely to find the time to come
				to our market, which can be hosted constantly if
				those in the caravan desire to host it full-time.

				</div>
				<p>
					This is how a nomadic caravan will look:
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<div class="callouttext">
						<ul>
							<li>
								One or more full time
								traveling caravans are
								formed.
							</li>
							<li>
								A caravan sets up a pop-up
								agorist marketplace on the
								outskirts of a city for
								approximately one month at a
								time.
							</li>
							<li>
								People from the caravan
								enter the city and spread
								the word through a variety
								of networking and
								advertising techniques about
								the alternate marketplace
								and offer opportunities for
								alternative ways of living.
								This is not unlike setting
								up camp on the outskirts of
								an enemy-occupied and
								controlled city, town, or
								village you wish to wage
								economic war with.
							</li>
							<li>
								The caravan leaves behind a
								full-time group committed to
								holding marketplaces and
								helping those in the city
								transition into a full-time
								agorist lifestyle.
							</li>
						</ul>

							<a href="caravanarchy.html"
								>Camp CaravAnarchy</a

							Our
							<a href="chewsabout.html"
								>&ldquo;Ice Cream
								Philosophy&rdquo;</a
							>
							is that we strive to bring to
							market the finest quality
							Homemade Ice Cream products,
							sourcing ingredients from as
							many agorist sources as
							possible, sourcing only the
							highest quality
							ingredients.&nbsp; If you want
							access to the best Ice Cream

							have to go through the agorist
							market.

				<div class="headerbox">
					<h3>The Market Circuit</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					We are creating a perpetual free market
					that will provide a safe space for
					people to buy and sell agorist goods
					without fear of the government. We
					travel from town to town, setting up in
					BLM land, staying for a month or more at
					a time, and from time to time venturing
					to private campgrounds for
					freedom-respecting festivals.
				</p>
				<p>
					We don’t need to convince more people
					that this way of living is viable. There
					are already enough people who have seen
					the vision of how a free and voluntary
					society would work - if every one of
					them started living their life in this
					new way, we would make a big enough
					impact to gain the attention of the rest
					of the world. This is not another
					intentional community. This is a
					strategy towards creating freedom for
					all that can be adopted by every person
					immediately. There is no central
					location or leader that can be taken
					down. Like an idea, it can only spread.
