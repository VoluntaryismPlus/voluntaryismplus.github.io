					<h2>Foundations of Our Network</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					The CaravAnarchy Network operates on
					principles of voluntary association,
					mutual respect, and personal
					responsibility. These guidelines aren't
					rules imposed from aboveâ€"they're the
					shared expectations that make peaceful
					cooperation possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					We don't have authorities enforcing
					compliance. Instead, we rely on each
					member's commitment to voluntary
					principles and the community's
					willingness to address problems through
					restitution rather than punishment.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- CORE NETWORK GUIDELINES -->
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>Core Network Guidelines</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					These principles apply to all
					interactions within the networkâ€"online
					spaces, meetups, property visits,
					business dealings, and personal
					relationships.
				</p>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>1. The Non-Aggression Principle</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>Do not initiate force, fraud,
							or coercion against any person
							or their property.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						This is the foundation of everything
						we do. You may defend yourself and
						your property, but you may not
						aggress against others. This
						includes:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Physical violence or threats
						</li>
						<li>Theft or vandalism</li>
						<li>
							Fraud or deception in trades
						</li>
						<li>Coercion or manipulation</li>
						<li>
							Violation of explicit agreements
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<em
							>If you violate the NAP, you're
							responsible for making
							restitution to those you've
							harmed.</em
						>
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>2. Consent is Mandatory</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>All interactions require clear,
							enthusiastic, ongoing consent
							from all parties.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						This applies to physical contact,
						use of property, business
						arrangements, and social
						interactions. Key principles:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>"No" means no.</strong>
							Full stop. No explanation
							required.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Silence is not
								consent.</strong
							>
							Assume "no" unless you have
							clear "yes."
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Consent can be
								withdrawn.</strong
							>
							At any time, for any reason.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Respect boundaries.</strong
							>
							When someone sets a boundary,
							honor it immediately.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<em
							>Consent violations are treated
							as NAP violations and require
							restitution.</em
						>
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>3. Personal Responsibility</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>You are responsible for your
							own well-being, safety,
							decisions, and actions.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						The network is not a safety net or a
						parent. We encourage mutual aid, but
						no one owes you support, rescue, or
						resources. This means:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Come prepared for your own needs
						</li>
						<li>
							Manage your own risks and safety
						</li>
						<li>
							Accept consequences of your
							choices
						</li>
						<li>
							Don't create dependencies on
							others
						</li>
						<li>
							Ask for help, don't demand it
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<em
							>Mutual aid is voluntary
							generosity, not entitlement.</em
						>
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>4. Voluntary Exchange</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>All trade, sharing, and
							cooperation must be voluntary
							and mutually agreed
							upon.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						No one owes you their labor,
						resources, or time. Every exchange
						should be:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Mutually beneficial</strong
							>
							- Both parties gain value
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Clearly agreed</strong>
							- Terms are explicit and
							understood
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Honored fully</strong> -
							Follow through on commitments
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Fairly represented</strong
							>
							- No deception about what's
							offered
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<em
							>Failure to honor agreements
							damages trust and may result in
							loss of network access.</em
						>
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>5. Restitution Over Punishment</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>When harm occurs, the focus is
							making the victim whole, not
							punishing the offender.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						If you damage someone's person or
						property, you are ethically
						obligated to make full restitution.
						This means:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Acknowledge the harm you caused
						</li>
						<li>
							Work with the harmed party to
							determine fair restitution
						</li>
						<li>
							Follow through on restitution
							agreements
						</li>
						<li>
							Rebuild trust through consistent
							behavior
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<em
							>Refusing restitution or
							repeated harm results in
							community separation.</em
						>
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>6. Privacy & Discretion</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>Respect others' privacy and
							practice operational
							security.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						Many network members operate outside
						the state's preferred systems. This
						means:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Don't share others' real names,
							locations, or activities without
							permission
						</li>
						<li>
							Use encrypted communication for
							sensitive topics
						</li>
						<li>
							Don't photograph people without
							clear consent
						</li>
						<li>
							Respect pseudonyms and privacy
							preferences
						</li>
						<li>
							Don't bring unwanted attention
							to network activities or
							locations
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<em
							>Privacy violations endanger the
							entire network. Take this
							seriously.</em
						>
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>7. No State Involvement</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>Handle disputes internally. Do
							not involve police, courts, or
							government agencies.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						We resolve conflicts through
						voluntary arbitration, mediation,
						and community accountability.
						Calling the state on another network
						member is considered a severe
						violation except in cases of
						immediate life-threatening danger.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em
							>If you can't resolve conflicts
							voluntarily, you may not be
							suited for this network.</em
						>
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>8. Children & Families</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>Parents are responsible for
							their children's behavior and
							safety.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>Families are welcome, but:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Supervise your children
							appropriately
						</li>
						<li>
							Teach them to respect others'
							property and boundaries
						</li>
						<li>
							If your child causes damage,
							you're responsible for
							restitution
						</li>
						<li>
							Don't expect other adults to
							supervise or discipline your
							children
						</li>
						<li>
							Respect that not all spaces are
							child-appropriate
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

			<!-- CONFLICT RESOLUTION -->
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>Conflict Resolution Process</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					Conflicts happen. Here's how we handle
					them:
				</p>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Step 1: Direct Communication</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>Talk to the person
							directly.</strong
						>
						Most conflicts resolve here if
						approached calmly and honestly.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>State the problem clearly</li>
						<li>Listen to their perspective</li>
						<li>Seek mutual understanding</li>
						<li>Propose solutions</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Step 2: Mediation (Optional)</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>If direct communication fails,
							request voluntary
							mediation.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Choose a neutral third party
							both trust
						</li>
						<li>Present your perspectives</li>
						<li>
							Work toward mutually acceptable
							resolution
						</li>
						<li>
							Mediator facilitates, doesn't
							impose solutions
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Step 3: Arbitration (If Needed)</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>For serious disputes, both
							parties may agree to binding
							arbitration.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Select an arbiter both parties
							trust
						</li>
						<li>
							Present evidence and arguments
						</li>
						<li>
							Accept the arbiter's decision as
							binding
						</li>
						<li>
							Follow through on determined
							restitution
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>
						Step 4: Community Separation (Last
						Resort)
					</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>If resolution isn't possible,
							the community may separate from
							the problematic
							individual.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						This isn't punishment—it's
						recognizing that voluntary
						association includes the right to
						disassociate. Repeated NAP
						violations, refusal to make
						restitution, or inability to coexist
						peacefully may result in:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Loss of access to network spaces
							and events
						</li>
						<li>
							Removal from communication
							channels
						</li>
						<li>
							Notification to other network
							members
						</li>
						<li>
							Exclusion from future
							participation
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<em
							>This protects the community
							while respecting individual
							liberty.</em
						>

			<!-- FESTIVAL-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES -->
			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>Festival & Event Guidelines</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					When gathering in person at festivals,
					camps, and events, additional
					considerations apply to ensure
					everyone's experience is positive and
					the gathering space remains accessible.
				</p>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>
						1. Respect for Person and Property
					</h3>
					<p>
						The Non-Aggression Principle is
						paramount. Do not initiate force,
						fraud, or coercion against any
						individual or their justly acquired
						property. This includes physical
						harm, theft, vandalism, or
						unauthorized use of another's
						belongings.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong
							>Your space begins where
							another's ends.</strong
						>
					</p>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>
						2. Leave No Trace, Take Only
						Memories
					</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>We are guests in
							nature.</strong
						>
						Pack out everything you pack in, and
						more. This includes:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							All trash, recyclables, and
							personal waste
						</li>
						<li>
							Utilize provided composting
							toilets responsibly
						</li>
						<li>
							Clean up your campsite
							thoroughly before leaving
						</li>
						<li>
							Pick up litter you find, even if
							it isn't yours
						</li>
						<li>
							Leave the natural environment
							cleaner than you found it
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<em
							>Future access to gathering
							spaces depends on our
							stewardship.</em
						>
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>
						3. Voluntary Exchange & Mutual Aid
					</h3>
					<p>
						All interactions, including sharing
						resources, trading goods or
						services, and offering assistance,
						should be entirely voluntary and
						consensual.
					</p>
					<p>
						No one is obligated to help another,
						but we encourage acts of mutual aid
						and generosity as you see fit.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>
						4. Personal Responsibility &
						Self-Sufficiency
					</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>You are solely responsible for
							your own well-being, safety, and
							actions.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Come prepared with what you need
							(shelter, food, water, medical
							supplies)
						</li>
						<li>Manage your own risks</li>
						<li>
							Don't expect others to solve
							your problems
						</li>
						<li>
							While mutual aid is encouraged,
							it's not guaranteed
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>5. Sound & Space Awareness</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>Be mindful of your noise
							levels, especially during quiet
							hours.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Respect designated quiet hours
							(typically late night to early
							morning)
						</li>
						<li>
							If your activities affect
							others, find a mutually
							agreeable solution
						</li>
						<li>
							Music and loud gatherings should
							be in designated areas or times
						</li>
						<li>
							Consider that others may need
							sleep, quiet, or solitude
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>6. Consent is Key</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>All interactions require clear,
							enthusiastic, and ongoing
							consent.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						Whether social, physical, or
						otherwise, if someone says "no," or
						if there's any doubt, the answer is
						no. Respect personal boundaries at
						all times.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>7. Justice Through Restitution</h3>
					<p>
						If you cause damage to another
						individual's person or property, or
						to the shared natural environment,
						you are ethically obligated to make
						full restitution to the aggrieved
						party or to restore the damaged
						area.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong
							>This is not about punishment,
							but about making the victim
							whole and taking responsibility
							for your actions.</strong
						>
						Voluntary agreements on restitution
						will be encouraged and supported.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>8. Festival Conflict Resolution</h3>
					<p>
						Should a disagreement arise at a
						festival or event, follow the same
						resolution process:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Direct
								Communication:</strong
							>
							Attempt to calmly discuss the
							issue directly with the person

							Request a neutral third party to

						</li>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Voluntary
								Arbitration/Separation:</strong

							Submit to mutually agreed
							arbitration or agree to separate
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p style="margin-top: 1rem">
						<em
							>Please know that while these

							have methods for more complex

						<strong

							Keep your intoxication from

			<div class="innersection">
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>How These Guidelines Work</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					These aren't rules imposed by
					authority—they're mutual expectations
					that make cooperation possible. Here's
					how we maintain them:
				</p>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Community Accountability</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>Everyone enforces these
							guidelines through voluntary
							association and
							disassociation.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Reputation matters—your behavior
							affects your network access
						</li>
						<li>
							People choose who they interact
							with
						</li>
						<li>
							Repeated violations lead to
							social consequences
						</li>
						<li>
							The community protects itself
							through exclusion of bad actors
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>No Central Authority</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>There's no "network police" or
							enforcement committee.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						Issues are handled peer-to-peer
						through the conflict resolution
						process. Serious or repeated
						violations may result in community
						consensus to separate from an
						individual.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="callout">
					<h3>Host Autonomy</h3>
					<p>
						<strong
							>Property owners and event
							organizers have final say on
							their spaces.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're hosting an event or
						offering property access, you can
						set additional guidelines and remove
						people who violate them. Your
						property, your rules—within NAP
						principles.
					</p>
				</div>
