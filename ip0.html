        <h2>Method for Addressing Changes</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          When major changes threaten a relationship, there is
          always an opportunity for the couple to grow closer instead of
          growing apart.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, if one partner's <em>values</em> change, there
          needs to be a re-assessment of the relationship
          because they are effectively a different person
          from the one who made the initial agreement.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Each of these changes provides a grave challenge to
          the initial agreement. They may result in
          termination of the agreement by either party. But
          there is always a way to resolve any issues resulting from change if
          that is the desired path.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Issue: I am changing</h4>
        <div class="callout">
          <h5>Description:</h5>
          <p>
            I don’t know if I want to remain as I was when
            we met. I want to start living in a different
            way, doing different things, or being a
            different person.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>Solution:</h5>
          <p>
            Change is good. Sometimes it is scary when you
            don’t know the result of where the change will
            lead you. But there will never be a final
            destination. The relationship needs to be
            flexible enough to account for these changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I am changing, it is unlikely that my basic
            convictions will change. But if they do, we will
            have to make a new agreement. You will have the
            opportunity to opt out of making a new
            agreement.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>Suggestion:</h5>
          <p>
            Let yourself and your partner get to know the
            new you. Talk candidly about the effects these
            changes will make, making extra sure that you
            address how this will change things for your
            partner. Brainstorm ideas for how you can make
            this transition positive for them as well as
            you.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>
          Issue: I am discovering new things about myself
        </h4>
        <div class="callout">
          <h5>Description:</h5>
          <p>
            I might not have known before something about
            myself. That thing changes who I am, which
            changes our agreements.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>Solution:</h5>
          <p>
            It is no need for alarm when someone realizes
            they are different from what they thought they
            were. There is always something more to learn
            about yourself. As long as you take account of
            what this changes for your partner and they agree to the
            updated agreement, the relationship will
            survive.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>Suggestion:</h5>
          <p>
            Involve your partner in this process and make it
            into an opportunity to grow closer. Bring them
            along on the journey of self discovery and know
            that you can always choose how to interpret the
            outcome of these revelations, and therefore any
            choice that brings you farther from your
            relationship is avoidable. Remember, the
            relationship's agreement is not based on a feeling but based on
            mutual respect and commitment.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Issue: I am discovering more about you</h4>
        <div class="callout">
          <h5>Description:</h5>
          <p>
            I am seeing sides of you I may not have signed
            up for. I thought you were one way, but your
            actions seem to display a different thing.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>Solution:</h5>
          <p>
            I need to get clarity and may suspend my
            agreement until I can re-commit to the
            relationship.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>Suggestion:</h5>
          <p>
            Ask your partner for clarity with regards to any
            values or commitments you are concerned might be
            jeapordized by your partner's revealed self.
            Think of ways they can reassure you and
            reconfirm any tenets of your relationship that you
            are worried might change.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Issue: I have met someone who I like</h4>
        <div class="callout">
          <h5>Description:</h5>
          <p>
            Someone I met or already know is becoming
            attractive to me. There is something lacking for
            me in the relationship and I have found a hint
            about it in another person. It usually stems
            from the idea that this person could provide me
            with a different experience than I get
            currently. It may be that I see something in
            them that reminds me of a part of myself who
            isnt expressed with you for some reason or
            another.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>Solution:</h5>
          <p>
            If my partner is willing to work with me to find
            a way for this desire to be met by my partner or
            this part of me to be expressed with my partner,
            we can learn and grow stronger from this
            occurance.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>Suggestion:</h5>
          <p>
            Consider that the person you have become
            attracted to is both more and less than your
            perception of them. More in that they are their
            own whole person with their own set of contracts
            they are or are not upholding. Less in that the
            version of them you percieve is idealized, and
            they are likely not what you see them as. Take
            this as a safe opportunity to separate the
            idealized version from the person themselves and
            see how you and your partner can embody those
            traits you value, which have been gifted to you
            from this interaction.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>
          Issue: I am commiserating with others about you
        </h4>
        <div class="callout">
          <h5>Description:</h5>
          <p>
            I am finding it hard to resolve issues with you
            and I turned to someone else or multiple people
            and talked about you to them. My intention was
            to to get perspective, blow off steam, etc.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>Solution:</h5>
          <p>
            I will tell you as soon as possible about this
            occurance and work to regain your trust as well
            as resolve the issue with you as soon as
            posible, refraining from introducing myself to
            situations where I may be tempted to commiserate
            again until all issues are resolved. This may
            involve resolution with anyone I involved in a
            conversation about my partner.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>Suggestion:</h5>
          <p>
            Have compassion for the reasoning that lead you
            to talk to others. Make a plan to stop the chain
            of events that leads to these conversations
            before it gets to that point. There might be
            some underlying feelings that need to be
            adressed.
