      <h1>Collective Defense</h1>
      <div class="innersection">
        <h3>Security Without the State</h3>

        <p>
          "Without government, who will defend us?" This is
          perhaps the most common objection to stateless
          society—and one of the easiest to answer.
          Voluntary societies can defend themselves far more
          effectively than states can, for reasons both
          economic and strategic. This page explains why
          stateless defense is not only possible but
          superior to state militarism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key insight: the best defense strategy is
          avoiding conflict in the first place. Anarchist
          societies excel at this because they remove the
          perverse incentives that make states aggressively
          violent. When defense is truly
          defensive—protecting actual people and property
          rather than political interests—it becomes both
          more effective and far less costly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h2>Why States Are Aggressive</h2>
        <p>
          The most important factor in decisions about war
          is cost-benefit analysis. If a potential war
          provides little benefit to decision-makers and
          costs them significantly, it's unlikely to happen.
          States, however, have deeply perverse incentives
          that make them prone to aggression.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <h4>The State's War Incentives:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Politicians don't pay the costs:</strong
              >
              Wars are funded by taxpayers who have no
              choice in the matter. Decision-makers send
              other people's children to fight and spend
              other people's money.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >War profiteers benefit enormously:</strong
              >
              The military-industrial complex—suppliers of
              weapons, vehicles, equipment, and
              services—makes fortunes from war. These
              industries lobby aggressively for military
              spending and foreign intervention.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Political power increases:</strong>
              War consolidates state power, suppresses
              dissent, and allows leaders to claim emergency
              authority.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >No accountability for failure:</strong
              >
              Politicians who start catastrophic wars rarely
              face consequences. They're protected by the
              state apparatus they control.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          These incentives explain why states engage in
          endless wars despite overwhelming costs in lives,
          wealth, and stability. The people making decisions
          don't bear the consequences—so they make terrible
          decisions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h2>Why Stateless Societies Are Peaceful</h2>
        <p>
          Stateless societies flip these incentives
          entirely. Those who would choose war must fund it
          themselves, making aggression far less attractive.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Advantages of Stateless Defense:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Defense is cheaper than offense:</strong
              >
              What's needed for effective
              defense—decentralized response, local
              knowledge, defensive positions—costs far less
              than projecting power abroad.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No central target:</strong> Without a
              state apparatus to capture, there's no command
              center an invader can take over to control the
              population. Conquest must happen neighborhood
              by neighborhood, making it prohibitively
              expensive.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No extraction apparatus:</strong> Even
              if an invader conquers territory, they must
              build entirely new infrastructure to extract
              resources. There's no pre-existing tax system
              to hijack.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No geopolitical rivalry:</strong>
              Stateless societies don't engage in power
              games with foreign governments. They have no
              standing armies, present no threat, and give
              foreign states no reason to feel challenged.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Moral high ground:</strong> Invading a
              peaceful, stateless society is obviously
              unjust, undermining the aggressor state's
              legitimacy in the eyes of its own subjects.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h2>Making Invasion Costly</h2>
        <p>
          While stateless societies are unlikely targets, it
          would be naive to assume they'll never face
          threats. The solution is making aggression as
          costly as possible for would-be invaders—without
          creating a standing army that itself becomes a
          threat to freedom.
        </p>

        <h3>Decentralized Defense Networks</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of a single military hierarchy, stateless
          societies would have multiple competing protection
          agencies, armed citizens, and voluntary militia.
          This decentralization makes conquest extremely
          difficult:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            No single point of failure—defeating one agency
            doesn't control the territory
          </li>
          <li>Local knowledge and defensive advantages</li>
          <li>
            Flexibility and adaptation rather than rigid
            command structures
          </li>
          <li>
            Guerrilla tactics and asymmetric warfare favor
            defenders
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Economic Resistance</h3>
        <p>
          Protection agencies and market entities can make
          invasion economically ruinous:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Bounties on aggressor leadership:</strong
              >
              Rather than fighting soldiers, place bounties
              on the politicians and generals who order
              invasion. This encourages insurrection and
              makes decision-makers personally vulnerable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reward desertion:</strong> Offer
              sanctuary and payment to enemy soldiers who
              defect, especially if they bring weapons or
              intelligence with them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Welcome invaders economically:</strong
              >
              Local businesses, having no patriotic
              allegiance to a non-existent state, can
              welcome foreign soldiers as customers—blurring
              the line between occupation and immigration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Target decision-makers, not
                populations:</strong
              >
              Make it clear that retaliation focuses on
              leaders who ordered aggression, not on enemy
              civilians or conscripts.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          This approach—targeting leadership while offering
          peaceful alternatives to soldiers—creates powerful
          disincentives for war while maintaining ethical
          high ground.
        </p>

        <h3>The Assassination Politics Concept</h3>
        <p>
          Protection agencies, already skilled at
          apprehending people, would be well-positioned to
          credibly threaten or execute strikes against
          aggressor leadership. When politicians know their
          heads are on the line—not just soldiers' and
          taxpayers'—they're far less likely to order
          invasions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't about glorifying violence. It's about
          shifting risk back to decision-makers where it
          belongs. States make war cheap for leaders and
          expensive for everyone else. Voluntary defense
          makes it expensive for leaders and cheaper for
          everyone else.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h2>Historical Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          These aren't just theoretical ideas. History
          provides evidence that stateless or
          minimally-armed societies can persist peacefully:

              <strong>Countries without militaries:</strong>
              There are currently 16 countries with no
              military forces whatsoever, including Costa
              Rica and Liechtenstein (which abolished its
              military in 1868). These nations aren't

        <h2>Addressing Common Objections</h2>

        <h4>
          What about ideological or religious motivations
          for war?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Stateless societies eliminate many ideological
          triggers for conflict. Without a government to
          engage in disputes with foreign states, there's no
          entity to offend or challenge foreign powers.
          Individual hostility is far less threatening to
          states than government hostility. Additionally,
          the obvious injustice of attacking a peaceful,
          non-threatening society undermines the aggressor's
          legitimacy.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Couldn't major powers just nuke stateless regions?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Technically yes—but they could also nuke other
          states, and would have more reason to do so.
          Nuking a stateless region offers no strategic
          gain, creates environmental damage that affects
          the aggressor, and would be seen as monstrously
          unjust by the aggressor's own population,
          destroying internal legitimacy. The same logic
          applies to any overwhelming force: using it
          against peaceful, non-threatening populations is
          politically costly even for tyrants.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Wouldn't competing protection agencies fight each
          other?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Competition doesn't mean conflict. Agencies that
          gain reputations for starting fights lose
          customers. Those that resolve disputes peacefully
          and protect clients effectively gain market share.
          The incentive structure favors cooperation and
          arbitration, not warfare. See
          <a href="3_solutions.html"
            >Beyond State Solutions</a
          >
          for more on how competing agencies resolve
          disputes.
        </p>

        <h4>
          What about coordination in large-scale defense?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Coordination emerges voluntarily when needed.
          Protection agencies have strong incentives to
          cooperate against external threats—all their
          business depends on successfully defending their
          territory. Historical examples show voluntary
          coordination works: medieval Iceland's thing
          system, Swiss cantonal militias, and countless
          examples of voluntary collective defense
          throughout history. The difference is voluntary
          cooperation vs. forced hierarchy.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="innersection">
        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>
          Stateless societies face drastically lower defense
          needs than states. They're less likely to be
          attacked, and when threatened, decentralized
          defense is more effective than centralized
          militaries. The market provides superior
          protection services because providers must satisfy
          customers to survive—unlike state militaries that
          face no competition and serve political rather
          than defensive purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In effect, the defense problem largely solves
          itself when the state apparatus is dissolved. The
          incentives for aggression disappear, the perverse
          motivations that fuel war vanish, and what remains
          is genuine defensive capability based on voluntary
          cooperation and market efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should invasion occur despite these factors,
          competing protection services and market entities
          would respond effectively—not because of
          centralized command, but because defending their
          customers is literally their business model. When
          compared to the bloated, inefficient,
          politically-captured defense establishments of
          states, voluntary defense is both more ethical and
          more effective.
