					Our vision for a free and voluntary society is
					underpinned by clear philosophical principles and
					a strategic commitment to decentralized support.
					For a comprehensive understanding of our core
					beliefs and the fundamental role we play as
					network support, please visit our
					<a href="2_network.html" class="link-highlight"
						>We Are Network Support</a
					>
					page.
				</p>
				<p>
					This page outlines the actionable strategy for
					building that world—a plan designed for
					resilience, expansion, and inevitable success,
					independent of external systems.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection panel stack">
				<h2>Resilient Foundations</h2>
				<p>
					The likelihood of a proposal's success or failure
					lies in its definition and terms. Because the
					network is a system of ideas that can be recreated
					by anyone who has heard the methodology, our
					proposal requires no money and no one person or
					group to bring it through to completion. All
					that's needed is a simple redirection of attention
					and resources away from what's unsavory and
					towards a network that will truly provide for us.
				</p>
				<p>
					An idea can't fail when its success doesn't rely
					on monetary achievement, any one person attaining
					notoriety for a project, or the first iteration of
					the project to see the goal to completion.
					Different projects have failed due to definition
					alone. If the definition of success is that one
					location persists or that one group of people
					survives, the plan isn't great enough.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyone in the next 100 years could find this set
					of instructions and re-create what we're doing
					now. But there will be no need to start from
					scratch. As soon as the number of people are
					proliferating the ideas contained herein, there
					will be more aversions and more resiliency because
					of them. We don't need to be attributed to the
					version that succeeds. We will always only be one
					group who saw what was possible. We made sure to
					write down our ideas as we lived them out.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your work should be designed so that you want it
					to be stolen. Through replication grows notoriety.
					More people exposed means more people knowing it
					exists at all. If one person's desire for
					recognition, for ownership of an idea, an entire
					project can fail to launch. Our plan is, among
					other things, to spread to all people the
					recognition of what's possible and what's lacking
					in the current narrative. This will make it easier
					to take responsibility for one's own narrative
					outlook that they ultimately share with the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is the workbook for how the world succeeds
					when enough of us choose to do so.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection panel stack">
				<h2>Overview of Our High-Level Plan</h2>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>
							Those who already know about voluntaryism are
							all we need to make this happen. They redirect
							all their resources—their labor and thought—to
							the free world, cultivating a purely agorist
							marketplace and establishing protected living
							spaces where all interactions exist free of
							the state.
						</li>
						<li>
							Agorist goods and services are available at a
							lower price than those supporting the state. A
							resilient network forms that can provide
							everything the state claims to provide, but
							better.
						</li>
						<li>
							The marketplace flourishes, and people from
							the cities start coming to our marketplaces
							and events, learning about the real
							applications of Voluntaryism and how to
							create, find, or access their local network of
							protected free markets.
						</li>
						<li>
							Slowly, the state loses its grasp on our
							hearts, minds, and resources, and we
							transition fully into the new realm.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
					Join us in our journey to defund the state through
					counter-economics. We don't need to convert anyone
					to our cause. There are enough people already
					committed to liberty. All we need is to provide
					all those liberty-loving people more opportunities
					to work together so that all their wealth and time
					can be channeled into more wealth for them.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can all imagine ways that a limited number of
					people could take down the beast. For example, if
					all liberty-minded individuals refused to pay
					taxes, and it became a well-known movement,
					there's a good probability that the news would
					become viral and enough people would join in this
					endeavor to defund the government. There are also
					easy ideas for how to operate as a society beyond
					this defunding—coordinating with your friends and
					neighbors to show up as a group to the scene of a
					dispute or incident is a great example. This is
					also the concept of militia. Strong, ubiquitous
					self-defense is how we'll defend ourselves against
					foreign or domestic threats. We're providing and
					helping to provide whatever extra support systems
					are needed to get the solution going and to
					normalize conversations around the new lexicon of
					reality and the idea of having no overarching
					government.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection panel stack">
				<h2><em>Making the Switch</em></h2>
				<p>
					We don't need to escape this world. We have
					everything we need here to create the next phase
					of existence. This is the world that, in time,
					becomes the ideal world for each individual. How
					can each person have their own ideal coexisting
					with every other person's ideal, simultaneously?
					The answer is voluntary pluralism.
				</p>
				<p>
					To get a more concise and potent result, we're
					more concise with our parameters. We're not
					judging those who don't follow these parameters,
					but we're making a distinction within our own
					decisions to do business with others who are
					actively creating more freedom for others instead
					of creating only a space for themselves to
					temporarily reduce their own oppression while
					doing little to manifest or support protected free
					markets.
				</p>
				<p>
					We believe in real solutions, right now! We don't
					want to spend our lives working for other people's
					goals while doing nothing or very little toward
					what we're in this realm to achieve, which has
					nothing to do with slaving away for money.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a guide to the establishment of a society
					that is independent, interconnected, and free from
					coercion. Today, we have everything we need to
					circumvent the state entirely. Communities small
					and large are already flourishing all around the
					world, and what's lacking in the common lore is a
					larger and more liberating story we can all
					manifest into reality.
				</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<ul>
						<li>People don't see an option.</li>
						<li>We're creating an option.</li>
						<li>You can create an option.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
					Understanding what is possible will lead to a more
					extensive awareness and empowered utilization of
					these communities, both with each other and by
					those still more entrenched in the slave society.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection panel stack">
				<h2>Our Exit Strategy</h2>
				<p>
					Government should be optional, not required. We
					are <em>free</em> people, aren't we? We aren't
					trying to abolish the State. If there are people
					who still wish to use a State for provision of
					specific goods or services, they should still be
					free to contract in such ways, but again, they in
					the <em>new</em>
					realm will enter into such contracts voluntarily
					and with the free-will choice to say no without
					punishment or retaliation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The idea is to help everyone who's having trouble
					redirecting their income stream and expenditures
					to purely agorist sources—so we can keep the
					wealth in the family and grow a system that will
					stand resolute against all threats.
				</p>
				<p>
					We know this will work, and we want to help form
					and strengthen the bonds that will replace weak
					supply lines currently “providing” for us. The
					necessity of the State is the story we tell
					ourselves. We can get everyone we know to stop
					telling that story. We're building a network of
					capable people who can protect each other and the
					world. We're on voluntary teams that work outside
					of the government.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have a business model that can't fail. The
					value people are already generating can be
					redirected towards the agorist network and thus go
					much further towards true growth and prosperity.
					This enables a lifestyle maximized for freedom.
				</p>
				<p>
					All interactions we take part in are in a free and
					sovereign world. We're taking all transactions out
					of the city. We're making sure the money we spend
					goes towards a system that will protect us, not
					towards a system that will hurt us. So every
					interaction should be taken from the
					government/taxes and and utilized by only
					voluntaryists who are making the new world.
				</p>
				<p>
					We're creating spaces that you can live in free of
					charge so you can detox for as long as you need.
					Our network provides a means of achieving whatever
					life goals you have in a way that doesn't fund
					wars but actually helps others gain security.
					You'll see the way in which you can finally align
					yourself with how you're acting out your own
					real-life adventure. We have a way to help you
					expand your impact on those you care about while
					reducing your risk and the risk of those you do
					business with. With our network, you have the
					prospect of real security, wealth, privacy, and
					community. On top of all this, you'll witness the
					structure of the world change based on your input.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you see what's really possible in this
					moment, in this lifetime, you'll see the value of
					embarking on your own journey in the Realm. All it
					takes is spreading this knowledge to the people
					who will want to do something about it and create
					the change they want to see.
				</p>
				<p>
					The knowledge of our slavery is hardly as
					important as the knowledge of our power and all
					the tools and manpower that we already have at our
					disposal to fight back against tyrants through
					nonviolent, non-confrontational means.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection panel stack">
				<h2>Voluntary Pluralism</h2>
				<p></p>
			</div>
			<div class="innersection panel stack">
				<h2>Igniting the Engine</h2>
				<p>
					We are the Support Network, and we are igniting
					the engine.
				</p>
				<p>
					We don't need any one leg of the engine to survive
					continuously for the engine to roll on. Any single
					hearth can turn its engine on and off, but there
					will always be more engines firing and producing
					the change we need to move past the current binds
					we live under and into a realm of voluntaryism for
					all.
				</p>
				<p>
					When we create certain additional criteria for our
					interactions in addition to the NAP (which already
					underlies all of our interactions) we assure that
					our interactions will make the largest impact
					possible in the community that supports us.
				</p>
				<p>
					We need a community to support us in these ways:
					security, backups, community, etc. The everyday
					society we've come to know isn't providing for us
					in the ways we need, and we're being led to
					erroneously think ourselves powerless over our
					current state of mass-human-enslavement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having a protected community requires vigilance,
					decentralization, sound principles, and a
					plurality of voluntary strategies aimed at meeting
					needs.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection panel stack">
				<h2>Come With Us</h2>
				<p>
					Come with us! We will help all of your wildest
					dreams come true. It doesn't matter where you are
					or how you live...
				</p>
				<p>
					You can take action to become more Agorist without
					compromising your ideals and goals. If you have a
					job, any job, you can do it for the network. If
					you have a dream, you can dream it better without
					the current restrictions of the state. You don't
					need money to make something survive. You need an
					idea.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any action can be a good expenditure of time, but
					the person acting has to be self-aware of the
					action's context in the larger community. Most
					actions can be done in a way that leads toward the
					freedom we all seek.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to achieve a peaceful anarchist pluralist
					society, enough individuals must choose a
					lifestyle that makes freedom a more comfortable
					and easy choice for others while avoiding choices
					that perpetuate self-enslavement by making it
					easier or more comfortable for people to continue
					making lifestyle and purchasing decisions that
					perpetuate the continued existence of the State.
				</p>
				<p>
					No business built, family established, or garden
					tended will make the world more free if those
					things are not also done with the intention of
					making the choice of freedom for others more
					appealing than the "statist-quo".
				</p>
				<p>
					The world today isn't designed to make your path
					to freedom from government accessible, but rather
					to make the choice to surrender your freedom as
					easy and comfortable as possible. It's filled with
					institutions and ideologies designed to make
					freedom seem impossible in this lifetime and to
					make your time and wealth exploitable by people
					who thrive on your continued lack of freedom and
					lack of hope for such.
				</p>
				<p>
					They want you thinking that it's impossible to
					achieve freedom. Our job as freedom-bringers is to
					make the agorist path the path of least resistance
					for others. That is, freedom-bringers must create
					a world where freedom from taxation and regulation
					is as accessible as possible to others.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each individual can design their life to live with
					intention toward the maximization of freedom in
					this lifetime. This website aims to explore and
					facilitate various ways of life that will bring us
					as close as possible to anarchy in this lifetime.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="innersection panel stack">
				<h2><em>The Agorist Economic Advantage</em></h2>
				<p>
					The worst evil is people still believing and
					perpetuating the lie that their neighbors must be
					controlled by the government. No individual or
					group of individuals can possess authority, or
					"the right to rule," over others. You own yourself
					and 100% of the fruits of your time and labor,
					which can be thought of as an extension of
					yourself on this planet.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our plan is to provide people with options to
					transfer their work and living situations into a
					new realm or state of existence where they're not
					bound by government systems of control. Your way
					of living should be an act of rebellion that helps
					make people's choice for freedom a no-brainer.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many ways in which this plan is unique
					to any we've seen so far. The unique attributes of
					our plan provide a strength and resilience that
					helps it transcend the pitfalls of other
					initiatives and businesses. Unlike a proposal that
					requires massive funding to get off the ground, we
					already have much of the infrastructure needed in
					place. All that's needed is to transition
					businesses that are funding the tax system into
					the new, free realm. There are no extra startup
					costs to create a business in the network—no fancy
					degrees or licenses are needed. Vending, selling,
					trading, and providing your good or service is
					free of compulsory licensure or fees. This
					initiative is aimed at people who are already
					trying to make a living and who already have
					resources invested in themselves and could benefit
					from shifting their business towards a tax-free
					network that will provide them with opportunities
					for growth, a greater sense of purpose and
					connection with their customers, and lasting
					prosperity.
				</p>
				<p>
					What we're describing is a lifestyle and
					resource-allocation strategy. The more people are
					empowered by these strategies, the stronger they
					become and the more everyone involved benefits.
					The success of the network isn't tied to any
					individual's success.
